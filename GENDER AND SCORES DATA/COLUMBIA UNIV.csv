Makes the course empirically challenging while grounded in relevent policy. He invested extra energy into designing an incredibly well structured course.', 'Complicating simple ideas.', 'He is not a good professor.', 'Great instructor who puts a lot of effort in organizing the class, with excellent notes. The problem sets are creatively designed to talk about current issues. Responds well to questions and is extremely helpful.', 'He is a wonderful Professor that really cares about his students and wants them to succeed, he is also very flexible and is willing to devote extra time if you need it.', 'Great teacher. Supplements the material with problems and examples from whats happening in the world.', 'The course is a lot of work,but he is really invested in students learning the material.', 'He is teaches alright.']"

Richard Hara,female,1,"['One of my favorite professors in the Columbia school of social work program! Do yourself a favor and take him, especially for health care policy!', 'Such a great professor!!! I am happy I took him after hearing negative feedback about other professors in the health care policy section.', 'I seriously lucked out by taking Professor Hara for health care policy! He fostered a welcoming classroom environment, which allowed for interactive learning process. He was also very approachable and understanding, basically everything you would want in a social work professor. He as well gives you all the resources you need to succeed, take him!', 'I am so happy I took Professor Hara for my health care policy class!! He made the subject of policy easy to comprehend and his assignments/readings were interesting and relevant to the current sociopolitical climate. He was as well very understanding and clear in his grading requirements, do yourself a favor and take him!!', 'Dr. Hara is knowledgeable and extremely thoughtful. His teaching style is collaborative and he is extremely fair in grading. I learned so much form the class and his personal experiences. I loved the class!', 'Professor Hara is extremely thoughtful, well-spoken and attentive to student needs. His approach is though-provoking and collaborative as he encourages students to provide input and direct class conversation through their contributions. Professor Hara is attuned to the finer points of social work such as psychodynamics, use of self, ethics, etc.', ""While Prof. Hara is nice and means well, his classes are extremely boring and dry. We spent the entire time on our laptops looking at Facebook. He doesn't have enough variety in his lectures. That said, he's a pretty easy grader.""]"

Brings a global perspective to his class which most Americans do not.', ""He's one of the best I had at CU. funny and compassionate."", ""Scared me at first. He's a hip hop and martial arts expert. It turns out that he's caring and compassionate but obviously not a pushover. As it states on hi syllabus: come strong or don't come at all."", 'I miss the coolest prof ever.', ""He's reminded me of one of the kids in high school who everyone wanted to hang out with. Our classes flew by. I wish he would have lectured more because he seems like he has a lot of useful information about pedagogy and life in general."", ""I think everyone at CU has a crush on him. More of a gansta than a prof but he's smart even if he doesn't seem it."", 'I thought I was going to hate his class; in the end I loved it. The man is cool, cocky, and a true nonconformist but at the end of the day, he cares about all of us.', ""It was like being at a comedy club every week. Why isn't this guy on tv?"", ""Definitely teaches out of the box. But he's a welcome change from the stringent political correctness that sometimes stifles us here. And he's a hellava writer."", 'Great!!!!', ""Dude's my dude. Doesn't fit in here; doesn't want to. Irreverent humor. Lots of knowledge. Lacks patience sometimes."", ""Conti is not your typical professor. He's young, he acts young. I think he misses being a student. The tats, muscles, and New York attitude can be a bit intimidating but once he sees you work hard he'll go all out for you. Just don't be late or defend texting... Its a no-win situation!!"", 'great guy. down t earth, really cares.']"
Giacomo Santangelo,male,1,"['I took his class at Fordham University, and he was a great professor. He makes international economics easy to understand, and his lectures are enjoyable. Only 3 tests and no homework. There is a textbook but I only used it to study before exams and still got an A. Would highly recommend.', 'Similar to previous comments, he makes public economics very easy to grasp. Seemingly random things like talking about Britney Spears, sparks up the class but some things he talks about are actually relevant to the class. Real life and engaging examples. What more can you ask for. Helpful too.', 'Love him. Brilliant, entertaining, funny. Makes economics interesting.', 'He was very boring and I had trouble staying awake.', ""He IS brilliant...he does talk about random things, it's just that You need to be smart enough to relate them to what you're supposed to have been reading in the textbook. He is able to use real life examples and relate them to the material in ways that make the most complicated topics seem easy. Just do the readings and pay attention"", 'Santangelo you bailed on FU for Columbia?! You will be missed...', ""at first, i thought he was brilliant.. then i realized we weren't learning anything at all. every lecture, he just talks at random about recent movies, everyday experiences like buying a tv, and a myriad of other anecdotes. occasionally he'll pull up a slide. midterm and final questions come out of thin air. then you get screwed over with a B or C.""]"
Steven Feiner,male,1,"['Really helpful professor. Listened to students always', 'He literally wrote the book on computer graphics', 'I took me 3 tries of doing poorly on his tests to figure out how best to study for his exams: you need to memorize alot! 4 try and I got it. Projects are very demanding.', 'This professor obviously has total disdain for his students (all but PHds). He make disparaging remarks about some students that might not get the material instantly, is poorly prepared for lectures, and shows no interest in them. Many later assignments in the semester are mostly unsolvable and this from a student that did well in his classes.']"
John Bennet,male,1,"[""If you're a good writer and you want to become a great one, take Bennet. You will never get track changes. You will have to read aloud and have oral macro edits. Write down all his aphorisms. Remember these: Make it interesting (pitches included), no cliches EVER, make your scenes into a movie, a good idea is 90% of the work & above all write well."", ""John is great. Yes, you will never get anything back line edited from him, but when you read out loud in class, he gives you the edits that are most important. His value is in the ear he has as a longtime editor - he know what works and what doesn't just by listening to your text. His overall wisdoms about writing and life are very valuable too."", ""Oh my god, what are you people talking about. You should write down every damn thing he says because he is WISE. People who complain about him are dolts who just want to get ahead and don't understand instruction that doesn't come in the form of line editing. Man."", 'Funny and entertaining. But he keeps telling us not to be magazine writers, so why are we even bothering?', ""John may not do line edits, but he also doesn't leave you feeling like an idiot. He works to get to know each student by arranging a lunch with each of us. Taking a class with John allows a j-school student to go outside the boundaries. He's amazing, he's honest and he allows a student to feel proud about their work while criticizing all the while."", ""Bennet works at the New Yorker. He tells good stories but he makes students read their work out loud....not fun. He also rarely gives detailed line edits to stories and is generally detached. He didn't get to know me at all.""]"
Richard Pious,male,1,"['every other professor pales in comparison to Dr. Pious. He is absolutely the best teacher I have ever had including grad school.

A lot of work but it's worth it"", 'THE BEST OF THE BEST. No TAs, you get a real feedback from a professor. Superb scholar; his lectures are the most fascinating lectures ever. He really cares about you & is glad to clarify the material. He actually teaches you; what I learned in his class got me through my pol sci major. I learned in his class more than I did in all others combined.', 'If you have come to the University to learn, then there are few professors who you should rather than a class from than professor Pious. He knows what he is talking about, demands that his students learn, but gives you the tools to do it with. You will come out knowing more than when you went in, and that is the goal of going to a school like columbia. If you are there to play, to put your feet up on the chair, and get offended easily, go to another class or school. he treats you like and adult and expects', 'No Comments', 'Has his shtick down pat.

Monique Jethwani-Keyser,male,1,"['Too rigid and machine like. Has no empathy for student in struggle. To the point and lazer focused on weekly topic. Rarely talks about oppression and inequity as it relates to practice. Very bright but needs to meet students where there are.', 'Prof. Jethwani is direct and to-the-point. She is not your friend, but she is there to help you. She is very knowledgeable about evaluations and has a lot of real-world experience. Class wasn\'t much ""fun,"" but you learn.

She definitely expects participation, effort, and deeper thinking from her students, but she is a really brilliant facilitator and lecturer. Be prepared to have something to contribute about the readings!', 'Professor Jethwani is a really great professor. There are a lot of readings and class participation counts. If she feels the class is not reading, she will give a pop quiz. Luckily, our class was very engaged and participated often. No exams, just a interview check in, thesis proposal, and paper.', ""Monique is a great professor, but not the warm kind who I would go to for advice. She keeps herself distant from her students but was a wealth of knowledge. Haven't even opened the Textbook but she gives LOTS of readings. Make sure you read at least one and have something to say. She will give a pop quiz if she thinks people aren't reading."", ""There is only one paper, and unfortunately, this professor and the 3rd one in the 3-module course didn't focus on the Developmental Life Course as much as Prof. Cogburn did. This was detrimental to students writing the paper, but that is a whole separate rating, to be honest."", 'She is way too boring. Lectures are so dry and uninteresting! I would really advise against taking this class.', 'Nice enough, clear, and fair. My only real complaint about Professar Jethwani is that although her lectures had generally interesting subject matter, they were extremely dry which made engaging difficult.', 'I had her for Clinical Case Evaluation, she was outstanding and extremely knowledgeable . I highly recommend her. Only negative was that the class was too big (50 students) for graduate level.']"
