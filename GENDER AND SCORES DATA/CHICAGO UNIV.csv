Gerry Brady,female,1,"[""Honestly, Professor Brady is the best professor I've ever had in Computer Science. The level of detail that she is able to break down a problem is absolutely incredible . Trust me when I say this, but you won't get a professor with that kind of diligence in CS ever. She provides foundations and inputs unique insights on how to solve a problem."", ""Dry lectures,covers standard material, no inspiration, bad attitude & always grumpy.. just read her slides/notes from a classmate instead of attending. It is quite easy to present math in a straightforward manner and still be clear like a textbook but she does nothing extra you can't read directly from a book"", ""Algorithms is one of the hardest classes I've ever taken, and it's no understatement to say that I don't know how I would've made it through without Gerry Brady. She really cares about her students, and puts an enormous amount of effort into her lectures -- and it shows."", ""Gerry cares a lot about her students, but she is not a great teacher for this subject. She does not introduce topics with context, and distill the material into it's essential points. To put it another way lecture is like someone reading straight out of the textbook. You're better off learning the material through videos online, much clearer."", ""Lots of people told me to just learn comp sci on my own - Gerry plays into that advice. She does not add value as a professor. Gerry's lectures are like reading out of a textbook.

She doesn't distill jargon into wisdom."", 'Professor Brady is an incredible teacher. I had her this last quarter for algorithms, and am convinced she is the reason I enjoyed the subject so much. It was certainly difficult, but I felt that she made the material understandable. The only issue I took was her choice of TA - one of the TAs was excellent while the other was not as qualified.', 'Gerry is the best professor I have had in CSPP. Her classes are challenging. Homework are hard but that is how you learn. Tests are fair. She uses the board a lot. Make sure to take notes.', ""Very enthusiastic and helpful to her students. I loved the subject even more thanks to her style. I don't agree that her questions were too hard. She writes too much on the board though. I wish she uses PowerPoint more often."", 'Gerry is quite simply one of the very best professors I have ever had. She will call on you of the blue and expect you to know the answer, which kept me very engaged in the class.', ""Algorithms is a difficult topic...I'm not sure I would have understood everything if it wasn't for Gerry."", ""Professor Brady's Algorithms course is difficult - as it should be. It was an excellent experience and will push the average students to their best."", 'Gerry rocks.', 'A gem of a teacher, Professor Brady is professional and personable. She has obvious command of this subject and is interested in her students. The material is difficult, but in some measure the difficulty will depend on your background. In any event, Gerry Brady is the prof to cover this with. Even with my limited skills, I did well in her course.', 'Gerry is an amazing teacher - she explains difficult concepts in a patient and clear manner, is available to help students outside of class, and is inspirational in the breadth and depth of her knowledge of the topic.', 'No Comments']"
Charles Lipson,male,1,"['He is so overly proud of himself, arrogant, not accessible to his students, and leaves virtually all of the class grading and teaching to his TAs.

Bernard Harcourt,male,1,"[""Great lectures, when focused; however, the quality of his seminars are often too dependent on the passivity and activity of the students.

Lots of tangents for sure, but those only served to give a glimpse of the larger, complicated, organic backdrop of the law. To me it was fascinating. To him, clearly EVERYTHING is fascinating. He has an infectious enthusiasm that brings the law to life.', ""I completely agree with the other person who posted, this man doesn't even do the readings he assigns and often loses track of what he is trying to say. cares more about personal appearance than his lecture."", ""Horrible.

I wish he'd realize that relying upon one's lecture notes so heavily is not good teaching. He also needs to learn time management/when the class ends. I also wish he'd learn how to explain concepts more clearly."", 'this guy is so full of himself, he should not be teaching anymore.', ""The coursework is exceptionally important. This is one of the best courses I ever had. It's hard to tell how great he is or how much the preceptors, texts, and collective interest of my classmates had to do with making this class special."", 'Regardless of whether he is brilliant or not, he is certainly presumptuous and rude.

Tread lightly and with sagacity.', 'prof macaloon is one of the most captivating, brilliant, and remarkable teachers i have ever had..anyone who comments on his arrogance should know it is well warrented-the man has hundreds of webpages, is respected around the world, and i feel luck to have taken a class with him!', 'Guy is very full of himself, aggresive when questioned in any way -- and likes to gossip about other faculty in ways that are not appropriate IMHO.', 'bad', ""cool guy, very interesting and smart. those of you who complain ab/ his arrogance must not have spent much time in the university atmosphere...or in the world in general. a genuinely good guy who is often fascinating in class. he sometimes speaks brashly, but anyone with social skills can realize he's joking. he will really make you think."", 'No Comments', ""I don't think I have to mention the ego. Yes, it's enormous, and mostly unwarranted. But he does have a (very dry) sense of humor, which makes some classes more bearable than others.

Guy studied under Victor Turner, so he knows his stuff. Plus, if you take the time to get to know him, it's worth the investment.

Grace Tsiang,male,0,"['I did not have Grace for class other than the honors workshop, but she was an invaluable resource throughout my econ undergrad experience.

She and Victor are stalwarts of the department.', ""I also went in to speak with her as an undergrad about my interest in getting a grad degree in econ. She said that I couldn't possibly be truly interested in that path. Without the advice, I didn't take the right steps and am struggling still to pursue my dream.

She's extremely smart and a great teacher, too."", 'I emailed a reasonable question about the Econ major and her response was simply: Why do you think you can be an Econ major?', 'I met with Grace once to discuss whether economics was the right major for me, and she acted like I was intruding on her time and was very condescending to me. One would think that, as the director of the undergrad econ program, she would be passionate about discussing such a subject with a first-year. Hopefully someone else will replace her.']"

Also, efficiently cuts off irrelevant student rambling during class discussion.', ""This man is not pretentious; he is simply brilliant.

Keep it up Jim"", 'Professor Veeneman seemed like a good teacher. Very interesting the first day, but then class after class he started getting off topic. Then students were faced with a midterm exam that everybody would have failed if not for a generous curve.

The prof is funny and passionate about the subject. He cares most about students learning the material.', 'The class was really relaxed, but I feel this was one of the strengths of the class.

I woul definitely recommend this class to others because the professor is fun, has a real passion for the subject, and is genuinely concerned for students', ""I was VERY disappointed with this class. I expected a lot more. The professor seemed disorganized and it was never clear what we were supposed to cover in a given class. Thus, I only got a fraction of what I could have out it. I was definitely willing to work, but the prob sets felt like a waste because we often didn't have the tools to do them"", 'I really enjoyed this course and learned so much in just 10 weeks. I wish SSA would offer this course in two parts one to focus on the Financial Statements and one to focus on budgeting. Great class!', 'Also would have liked to have stayed on track with the lecture slides.

Prob Sets ended up piling up b/c of time management; perhaps keep due dates for prob sets but add a TA session for those who need it.', ""The posted slides were a very helpful learning tool, although I wished we would have been able to stay more on target during class time. Also, I appreciated Veeneman's enthusiasm and desire to challenge us as students (although some of my classmates expressed their malcontent over the expectations I thought his challenging was appropriate.)"", 'Professor very accessible. Email & office visits readily available to students and response to questions is quick. PowerPoint slides very good - synthesize necessary information. Sometimes homework questions did not appear in readings, which was challenging but solvable. Required time & effort to master material. Was req course, so somewhat limited interest prior to start of quarter, but it proved to be very interesting & valuable.', 'SSA needs more Veeneman. This class is a critical part of the curriculum at SSA and Veeneman adds tremendous value from years of experience. There is so much material that could be covered, I was frustrated by the rambling, unfocused classes-stay on task and make lectures more targeted and efficient. The homework was extremely helpful.', ""This was on of the most interesting classes I've taken at U of C. His teaching style and personality combine dramatically! Too few professors case so much about the beauty and curiosity of learning. He engaged students and truly facilitated mutual learning. Jim is highly ethical and places high peformance standards on students"", ""This was a class that you got out as much as you put in... a guided indep. study. It wasn't as organized as well as it could be, and the lectures felt like a Tony Robins seminar on the virtue of finance for NPOs. However, I got a lot out of the class and would take him again. Get organized and things would be excellent... tremendous potential."", ""Yes, the professor wasn't skilled at staying on point and getting a job done, but was helpful in delivering messages that are critical to the work of non-profit management. More importantly, the SSA process for evaluation is far more useful than this and also should have been employed."", 'This is the worst class I have taken. His stories and unrelated comments took away from valuable learning time and wasted our tuition money. He is very intelligent but does not know how to pass on the knowledge.

Armed with prodigious learning, he plays his cards close to his chest but always strikes with questions whose slow quiet inevitability cut to the heart of the matter.', 'Straussians can be scary in their reverence for classic texts, but Tarcov is relatively benign in this respect.
