            "Prof Khanna is super cool & relaxed. He thinks very deeply about art, filmography, & culture. He tends to go on tangents that are hard to understand & extremely profound. But all in all, the films he assigns give great insights into Indian culture & life, even for those from an Indian background. Assignments graded easy if you show you care!", 
            "Satti Ji is one of the most compassionate and insightful people you will ever meet. I took his class years ago but he still remains one of my favorite instructors. If you can't get along with Satti Ji, you have serious issues!", 
            "I really liked Sattiji as a person, but not so much as a professor. The entire class is in Hindi, and each week you have to write a 2-page paper. Grading is very arbitrary. I never once got better than an A- on an essay. Fun topics, but the readings are hard to understand, and the class itself is challenging if you're not a native speaker.", 
            "The class is not too difficult, he expects you to write a 2 page paper every week and record it. But to be honest, it's pretty low key. Sometimes we listen to each other's recordings in class and it can be really funny. We'll also watch movies in class and go through all the readings together to make sure we get it all", 
            "One of the most confusing classes I've ever taken!! At the beginning of the semester he said we would be graded on the writing assignments on each of the films. At the end of the class he revealed our entire grade was based on \"exercises,\" which were these bizarre short films he had us make on our iPhones--nothing to do with Indian Cinema at all!!", 
            "Sattiji makes class a fun experience and the discussions are very engaging. You'll write an essay, do translations, read bits of a story, and watch part of a movie every week so it can be a bit time consuming (but not too difficult). Grading criteria was somewhat unclear though.", 
            "The class requires very little work, and you can get by with doing almost nothing. But, your entire grade is based on short videos. Sounds easy, except for the fact that he offers no clear expectations whatsoever. When asked for clarification, he makes the prompt even more confusing. Brilliant individual with great insight, but bad class.", 
            "He's a very intelligent professor but the movies to seen in this class are very off-beat and old, however some of them are amazing. His grading criteria is quite vague but if you show effort and follow his prompts you'll end up with an A", 
            "Satti Khanna is a very intelligent professor with tremendous potential which is unfortunately marred by his desire to have students agree with his point of view. He can not accept differing points of view, even if they are substantiated, and grades accordingly. I find this antithetical to the core of a liberal arts education!", 
            "Brilliant", 
            "Satti Khanna is an exemplar of wisdom and dignity.", 
            "The best professor I have ever had at Duke. He is extremely knowledgable and challenges you to explore yours. It is not hard to get an A, if you do his work diligently and participate in the class discussion actively. He deserves some sort of recognition from Duke! I took 3 classes with him, loved them all.", 
            "He is amazing! Such a wonderful man and is really kind to all of his students. His assignments are fair and you do need to put effort into whatever work he asks for in order to get an A, but it is not difficult to be interested in the material. One of the best professors I've had at Duke.", 
            "One of the best professors! Even though both of the Hindi classes I took with him were 2.5 hours long, I never felt bored. He is not a harsh grader and if you really put your heart into the class, you will be surprised to see how much knowledge you have gained by the end of the semester :)", 
            "Spectacular", 
            "Satti ji likes when people come up with crazy ideas and stuff, he doesn't really accept normal thinking.", 
            "Satti-ji is different from any teacher you'll have - he operates at a completely different level. He really should consider teaching philosophy classes as well. Some people find his style frustrating, but I thought he was fantastic. Very supportive and loves any type of creativity!", 
            "Great teacher- very interested in students who take an interest in the coursework. Does his office hours at a coffee shop. One of my favorite professors at Duke. That being said, you get in what you put in. He gives his students a lot of creative freedom, and if you really put yourself into your work, he is appreciative.", 
            "Worst teacher I ever had", 
            "Satiji is extremely deeper than any ocean that exists on the planet. His analysis of literally anything is so deep that you really leave each class amazed that anyone is that deep. Other than that, expect Hindi 100% of the time, a good amount of work each week, and some enlightening discussion. As for grading, easy to get an B+/A-, hard to get an A"

Coggins overall is a great biochemistry teacher, and I learned a lot!",

He doesn't use a textbook and his powerpoints by themselves are kinda vague, so go to lecture. He makes the tests very reasonable if you put in the work for it. Overall a very fair and intelligent teacher and course.", 
            "Very clear and straightforward lecturer. Tests are super fair, and he's so accessible outside of class. Lectures got a bit dry at times, but the material was interesting, especially the last third of the class.", 
            "this man honestly just knows how to teach. he makes fantastic, direct powerpoints. his lectures are extremely well organized. he tells you exactly what he wants from you, in terms of what to memorize, what will be on tests. he provides tons of practice tests and practice problems. literally finally someone who wants me to do well", 
            "Legendary man through and through. Took us on a chemical journey from day one. No textbook necessary, his lectures provide the information needed on the exam, so try to not miss class. There is a good chunk of this course that is memorization-heavy but Coggins presents it well. Would recommend", 
            "Dr. Coggin's passion for biochem makes his lectures clear and enjoyable. Lecture slides are very streamlined; I recommend recording his lectures for reference. Exams are straightforward, and Dr. Coggins posts all prior exams the week before for practice. While this is an \"easier\" premed class, be prepared to work hard -- lots of memorization.", 
            "I came into this class expecting it to be no work because other premeds said it was 'super easy'. It is easier than orgo/physics and you can do well by straight memorization, but don't slack off on the first test because unlike orgo, you can't replace the lowest test with the final. Make sure you put time in and don't underestimate the class", 
            "Coggins is a fair teacher. No textbook necessary, and his instructions are clear. If you pay attention to his lectures and do all his practice exams, you'll do well. Find the TA that works for you and let them help you better understand (I rec Steve).", 
            "Dr. Coggins is truly a great professor. He gives super clear and articulate lectures with easy to understand slides if you go to class. Textbook not necessary - all the material from lectures. Hard in that there is a ton of memorization. But he gives you lots of past exams that help studying immensely. Psets and recitation helpful, not required.", 
            "Sweet adorable caring man. he's a teddy bear. made biochem bearable... but it was still hard, because it was biochem. pretty easy to get away with a B or so. great problem sets. posts lecture slides. really eager to help out and loves his subject so much. great guy. would recommend.", 
            "Coggins is a great professor! Solid lectures, although they can be a bit confusing at times. He is happy to clarify concepts after class and during office hours. Tests are challenging but fair and based on lectures and problem sets. Definitely would take again!", 
            "Prof Coggins is knowledgeable & connects the material to real life, discussing medical implications of the info (which is great, since most of the students are premed). He makes it clear what you need to do to succeed and the tests are super straightforward. You need to memorize a lot but conceptually the class is not too hard. Highly recommend!!!", 
            "Prof. Coggins is an extremely clear, albeit uninteresting, lecturer. Focus during his lectures and take notes, you will have excellent resource, which you need because exams (85% of grade) are entirely based on his lectures. Study thoroughly with the practice exams he gives, and you should do well. A bit of a victory lap class after orgo I/II.", 
            "Dr. Coggins is the man. I did badly on the first test, and he was willing to meet with me outside of class to help raise my grade. I eventually understood and really give him a lot of credit for his encouragement. That said, I did NOT like the grading format - the tests were worth 25% of the grade each and undroppable. Would take him again though!", 
            "I enjoyed his class and the material was really interesting. The exams are fair, but you need to keep up with the material and make sure to attend lectures because his tests are based on them (no need for the textbook). Do the problem sets and the previous exams and you'll be ok.", 
            "Clear lecturer w/ all test material taken from lectures (don't buy textbook). 3 exams (25/25/35% of grade) + weekly online/open-note quizzes (15% of grade) + weekly homework (ungraded). Many practice exams are posted, which are very helpful. Lots of content & it's very cumulative, so lectures can become hard to follow if you don't study regularly.", 
            "Coggins is an eloquent speaker and writer but extremely boring lectures. Course is generally very easy (haven't taken a premed class in a while as an engineer) and just proves my point that most premeds tend to complain for no reason. 100% memorization. No skill.", 
            "Coggins is one of the best lecturers out there. Indeed, the subject matter is a little dry, but he does an excellent job of teaching it. You have to go to class to do well, but the tests are pretty fair in general. The class also gets more interesting towards the end, and Coggins does a great job tying together themes from the entire semester.", 
            "Lectures are super dry and boring, but I think that's probably because of the subject itself. You can tell he's passionate about it but just doesn't do a very good job about getting anyone else excited about it. Students don't really respect him, either. His tests are almost exclusively on his lecture so you need to attend class (Fridays optional)", 
            "This is underratingly one of the easier pre-med classes. Its a lot of memorization, but the material isn't terribly complex and the tests are pretty straightforward. No lab component and optional friday discussions also makes this class very nice"

It makes class boring and slow, and it makes the material harder to understand. On top of that, he still requires attendance in lectures.",

He teaches the material super well and sets you up for success on the final",

Usually ends up reverting back to the same phrases/slides every class. Easy but unenjoyable class.",

            "The reason why this class was so full was because it was supposed to be easy--not anymore. Quizzes every class make up your final grade with no exams. Sounds great and was great for the first third of the semester until he decided to make the quizzes harder! Last 2/3 of the quizzes had some impossible questions drawn from random/unimportant topics.", 
            "Pretty good professor. The lectures can sometimes be a little slow, but he's had really interesting experiences that he shares. Easy tests if you study...about a question per test is poorly written, but he always adds a few points for misgrading or something and so it all works out. I highly recommend this class.", 
            "Class is excruciatingly boring and the tests are just random tedious trivia from the slides and the textbook?many of them on things he never mentioned in class. He's very fair, but it's just like a bad high school class. He's pretty cool, but thinks he's way cooler.", 
            "Churchill is by far one of the best teachers at Duke. He's legit in his field and has a million fascinating stories, plus is hilarious. His class is pretty easy because he's so interesting. Also, he really cares about his students. You have to ask for his help, but if you do he'll always come through. Take any class he teaches. Love him!", 
            "Very interesting and engaging lecturer. The Churchill/Rosenberg team for this class is very interesting-- Rosenberg's talks are very abstract and theoretical and Churchill's are more about presenting the data to back up the theory. One of my favorite classes at Duke so far.", 
            "Very concerned with student's success and understanding of the topics.", 
            "Make sure you complete all of the readings before a test. This class is not one to blow-off. His tests can be picky and tedious, but the class was enjoyable nonetheless. If you fall behind it can be difficult to catch up and you could very well end up with a B or a C...so be careful.", 
            "Awesome prof, very laid back, but NOT monotone. Very cute and very knowledgeable. Any class with him is highly recommended.", 
            "class not too hard, tests very detailed but you can get away with just doing a lot of work the night before the test and be fine. great for a natural science credit, teacher is pretty interesting", 
            "Cool guy. Good lectures that keep you listening. Class isn't that difficult, although you have to know every detail for his tests. Asks very picky questions on his test. I would say overstudy for his tests. Final is optional if you like your grade after the first 3 exams. The guy is great, take anything he's teaching.", 
            "I really enjoyed this class (Forensics), Churchill was funny, entertaining and really knew the material well.", 
            "Tries to be funny and cool, but clearly is not. He's a pretty good teacher though and the tests are straight from his lectures and PowerPoints (available on Blackboard)."

            "Dr. Rosenthal is a great professor and really makes class material come alive when he uses memorable anecdotes from real life. Tests are super easy if you read the DSM 5 for fun; otherwise, you might have to study. The course paper is very long, so definitely get started early. This class is still a relatively easy A.", 
            "Really awesome professor. Cool guy and he makes the lectures interesting. He tells stories about the fascinating things he's seen in his own clinical experience. Tests really not too hard if you take notes in class, and you don't need the textbook at all.", 
            "Two research reports (5 pages), one course project (10 pages), one midterm, and the final. Don't bother buying the book everything is from lecture. Lectures are mandatory if you want the easy A.", 
            "LOVE Dr. Rosenthal. Keeps class interesting with funny personal stories that will make you remember things. Best Prof I've had for an intro-level lecture course. Take good notes and go to class and an A is doable.", 
            "Great lecturer. Rosenthal is a very smart guy who really wants the class to learn and be excited about abnormal psychology. Alongside the wonderful TAs he keeps the course on a clearly outlined path that covers some very interesting topics. Clear grading, not an easy A but if you show up to lecture, take notes/pay attention, you will get an A.", 
            "Dr. Rosenthal is a great lecturer. He keeps class interesting. The exams are doable if you read the textbook and take notes in class. He is very knit-picky about language, but he makes sure to clarify his points if people are confused. Dr. Rosenthal also does his best to make sure the whole class is invested and paying attention to his lecture.", 
            "Lectures are mandatory unless you have a good friend who is happy with taking great notes and sending them to you. Both TA's my semester were dreadful which definitely doesn't help the cause. Tests are really difficult for an intro psych class, definitely don't expect an easy A. Take 104 with Robinson over this class.", 
            "This is a great class! However, getting an A or above isn't as easy as past posters have made it out to be. You need to study A LOT to do well on the exams. Also, you don't even need to read the textbook - everything (or almost everything) on the exams comes from his lectures. Make sure you can wake up for that 8:30. Work hard, and you'll do well.", 
            "This class is NOT as easy as people make it out to be. I took this class expecting an easy A and scraped by with a B+. Work load isn't heavy, but it is an 8:30 AM class and 25% of the final material comes from what was lectured in class. Averaged a B- on midterm/final, with heavy study. Tests are not curved, essay around 20 pages.", 
            "In my opinion, this class is not as easy as some of the post are implying. The class is pretty straightforward, but there is A LOT of information you need to know for the midterm and final (Including specific percentages and ratios). Rosenthal is a great lecturer, he keeps the class interesting. I wouldn't take it if you're not a psych major.",

The class only has two tests and one final paper. Prof. Rosenthal is really engaging and tells his own personal stories. Take this class!!", 
            "Dr. Rosenthal is a really great professor. I enjoyed having him (even at 8:30am). His Abnormal Psychology class is really engaging. I recommend going to all lectures, because there are pop quizzes that are easy points; however, sometimes he rushes at the end of class. Start studying early for exams, because they cover a lot of material.",

            "Dr. Rosenthal is really engaging. He made an 8:30 class interesting, and he offers a lot of interesting stories of real patients he's worked with. His grading is fair and tests aren't too hard. He gives pop quizzes but they're mostly to reward the people who come to lecture.", 
            "He is an awesome teacher and so fair in grading it's ridiculous. Yes, you have to review the lectures slides for a few minutes for a pop quiz, but they're very easy. The test is extremely fair too. I started studying the night before and got an A easily. As an engineer, a professor like Dr. R is a breath of fresh air. Hilarious & genuine guy!", 
            "This class isn't as easy as some posts are implying. His tests aren't easy, and some questions asked for specific percentages of disorders. He talks about a lot in lecture but goes over so much that it's hard to know what's important for the test. I would only suggest this course if you definitely are a psych major.", 
            "Great professor - if you need a psychology credit TAKE THIS CLASS. There are tons of extra credit opportunities and he makes class so fun and enjoyable. The one downside: his exams are very nit-picky (some questions were specific percentages for certain mental illnesses)."

There are no tests or quizzes in this class, no textbook, you just go to class and get to learn state-of-the-art material of a subject in which the guy is actually a world expert. Guaranteed A+.",

            "Meck was the worst professor I've had. Not only is he a poor lecturer, but he is extremely lazy and cancels class too often. On top of that, he is rude and dismissive to his students and is far from accessible outside of class. His lectures teach you nothing, and his study guides are your only hope for success in his class. Avoid at ALL costs.", 
            "Meck is a good researcher but also an incredibly poor teacher. He himself makes it clear that he doesn't care much for the class/students, so good luck getting help from him. The course material is really interesting, and it would be lovely to have a competent lecturer instead of Meck for this class.", 
            "Terrible lecturer, he is funny but he goes on in irrelevant tangents and lectures have NOTHING to do with the exams. The study guide he gives is helpful but incomplete since he is too lazy and usually just pulls up questions from old tests. Hard to get a good grade because it's hard to know what to study, even if the material itself is easy.", 
            "Nice, interesting guy; awful lecturer. Take this class with Bilbo instead if you can; she's really good. Easy to get an A in Meck's class if you use the study guide he provides but if you don't work hard to teach yourself the material alongside that, you will learn virtually nothing and it will hurt you big time down the line in the neuro major.", 
            "A more biological extension of Williams' neuro 101 class. Class is more stringently graded than Neuro 101 class that I took in the fall (which seemed to take points off arbitrarily). So not a hard class to do well in if you study the material from the textbook and resources posted under exam review. Meck is an interesting guy but lectures dont help", 
            "I've taken classes from other duke professors with abysmal ratings and thought they were fine - not this time. Never have I had a professor so awful at lecturing. First he hashes the same basic point over and over again. Then, he rambles. His ppts suck. Sometimes he pulls up wikipedia and lectures from there instead. Didn't learn a thing from him.", 
            "Meck is clearly a smart guy but his classes are completely irrelevant to the tests. He just rambles on about his own research and himself. He is incredibly lazy and repeats test questions that he gives on practice quizzes. Easy to do well if you know this and memorize answers, hard to do well if you attend lectures and try and learn from him.", 
            "Lectures and Powerpoints not useful. Tests are based only on what he goes over from the study guide. Practice quiz questions are very useful. The discussion section is much more stringently graded, and more interesting.",

He's not going to gift wrap you an A. He is extremely clear in lecture. However, I can't speak for his personality because I never went to office hours.",

Word around the chem department is that he will not get tenure, and since he's going into his last year before evaluation, he won't care about teaching at all. Avoid him at all costs in the Spring 2011 semester for Chem 152.",

I hate to admit this, but the guy can teach.",

Worst professor in the chemistry department by far. He is outright rude to many of his students and does not care about the class at all. A monkey could teach better.", 
            "To Coltart's credit, he is very good at teaching difficult materials and concepts. However, good teaching skills do not make a quality professor. And Coltart is one of the worst professors at Duke. There isn't enough space on here for me to list all the reasons.", 
            "Possibly the WORST professor in the entire world. Has extended response questions worth 4pts and multiple choice 'circle the answer' questions worth 15. O did I mention he is S**T at chemistry and his tests are littered with mistakes. My ass could write better midterms.",

Tests were fairly straightfoward and easy if you read the textbook and understand his 3 basic concepts that answer all his 'harder' questions. Not very approachable and makes you feel dumb. Lectures straight from the book.",

            "His class, Denial, Faith, and Reason: Sustainability and Survival was my absolute favorite compared to my past courses at Duke. The material and discussions forced me to reassess my own beliefs as I was confronted with my own biases/assumptions about different economic/social/political systems. The workload isn't light but he's a fair grader.", 
            "Professor Philipsen leads a seminar-style class.", 
            "Professor Philipsen is a provocative and passionate teacher, creating consistently interesting lectures. He genuinely cares that his students understand the material and empowers them to be change-makers.", 
            "Professor Philipsen is an amazing and inspirational teacher and I would highly recommend you take a class with him. Life Within Capitalism changed my perspective on so many issues, and despite having a lot of reading, the class is not too difficult.", 
            "This is the best class I've taken in my four years at Duke. While you're sure to gain plenty of knowledge in most of the courses you take here, I've not found another professor that truly teaches you to THINK, not memorize. My biggest regret of college is that I didn't know about this professor until my last semester. Don't make the same mistake!", 
            "Dirk is very well-intended and has an extensive background in ethics, economics, and policy. However, this is a guy who is almost too smart for his own good. He doesn't encourage student participation and the class can easily become a one-sided lecture. His feedback can also be really contradictory so you'll have to rely on your TAs for help", 
            "Professor Philipsen's was a great experience. He really challenges your worldview. While the class itself wasn't an easy A, I felt like I really gained a lot from his class. He gives out a moderate amount of readings and doesn't tend to give out lots of grades (<10) so be sure to be on top of things. I look forward to taking another class with him!", 
            "Professor Philipsen is an amazing amazing professor. He has changed the way I see the world, and is also such an amazing person. He is supportive, gives great feedback, and is very available. He wants to have personal relationships with all of his students.", 
            "Take a class with Dr. Philipsen! His passion for the environment and business ethics is apparent when he teaches. The class is not too difficult, but you will receive a lot of feedback. It's helpful though as you can build on your skills in a welcoming environment. Everyone should take his focus class as it is so relevant to society today!", 
            "The class time is worthwhile: he is amazing at lecturing in addition to opening up the floor for debate. Heavy reading and reading responses take forever, but it has allowed me to retain taught me to synthesize and produce my own arguments regarding a very interesting subject. He is kind, inspiring and gets to know students. I LOVED this class!!!", 
            "This class will change the way you look at the way we all live and interact in American society. Prof. Philipsen doesn't let you BS any assignments and gives detailed (but a bit harsh) feedback, but the work is definitely worth it.", 
            "Incredible professor, will change how you view the world. Grading could be arbitrary, but he curves to help kids get an A- or above. The Ethics Focus was awesome.", 
            "Philipsen is one of the most inspirational professors I've had. He's so passionate about the subject and has so much insight on it. He really likes to engage students with it. There are some really long and intricate assignments over the semester that aren't easy, but they're educational in their own way. I think everyone should take his class.", 
            "Awesome professor with great ideas! Dialogues and lectures are always intriguing and not boring, if you do your reading of course. There's a decent amount of work but you should be fine. Nothing comparable to math.", 
            "Professor Philipsen is really passionate about this subject and it's clear that he knows his stuff. As long as you are willing to put in some effort, you will get a lot out of this class both academically and in general. I really enjoyed the course and it's made me re-think a lot of preconceptions I had going into it. I would highly recommend it!", 
            "This guy is good", 
            "Professor Philipsen is an extremely passionate and empathetic teacher who invests himself into his teachings and students, in hopes that they leave his class thinking about life differently. One of the best classes I have taken, I learned a great deal from class and his office hours. There was a ton of reading, but definitely worth taking.", 
            "LOVE HIM TAKE ANY ALL HIS CLASSES!!!", 
            "This course confronts the realities of our climate crisis, but also leads students to new solutions. Dr. Philipsen pushes students to interrogate their assumptions and to develop their own arguments, which can be frustrating. But by the end of the semester you'll be glad you've critically examined the issues and defined your own position. Rec'd!", 
            "Dr. Philipsen is a good overall guy. I don't think I agreed with everything he said in the class, but I learned a lot. He opened up my thinking about the subject (capitalism and the environment) a ton and I appreciate that, not many professors at Duke do that. The material he assigned challenges all of our previous assumptions."

He makes class interesting and interactive, and is passionate about helping you learn. Best Spanish prof I've ever had, and in my top 5 professors ever. Participate and show interest, and you'll do well.", 
            "Joan is an incredibly kind and helpful professor. Always would give the student the benefit of the doubt and was a very fair, sometimes easy grader. Did assign a lot of readings but I was able to do well without reading that much. The guy really cares for his student and if you put in some effort you'll do great.", 
            "Spanish 302 (advanced Spanish grammar) was a very difficult class and it took a lot of work to get an A. That being said, I would definitely recommend any class with Professor Munn\u00e9. He's extremely helpful, clearly outlines/explains what he expects, and is overall very comforting in a difficult subject environment. Munn\u00e9 is great.", 
            "Incredible professor. Class was challenging, but he was willing to meet frequently and go over the smallest concepts. In addition to being a native speaker, he really gets the grammatical explanations. Gave study guides and review sheets that were exactly like the exams. Possible to do well if you put in the work. Homework was sometimes helpful.", 
            "Professor Munne was very responsive to how the class felt about a particular subject and his expectations were clear. There really isn't an excuse to do poorly in the class because he's the kind of professor that wants you to do well.",

            "By far the best Spanish professor I've ever had, one of my favorite professors overall. Really nice, incredibly helpful and patient, willing to sit with you and work on a tiny concept forever until you get it. I don't recommend him for intro courses because he has high standards but as a 300+ level teacher he's fantastic.", 
            "Profesor Munne is excellent at teaching and is very enthusiastic in interacting with the class. It seemed like we were assigned with more work than the other sections did, but the homework really helps. I don't think he really liked me, but the class was enjoyable. It's not difficult at all if you put the work into it.", 
            "BEST SPANISH PROFESSOR AT DUKE. period. He's not an easy professor, he expects hardwork out of you but he also extremely helpful and teaches very well. Wish I could take his class again. If you can, do it!", 
            "Fantastic professor, great guy. Favorite Spanis teacher I've ever had, and I've had some good ones. Expects a lot out of you, especially with participation, but gives a lot in return. Office hours are very helpful. If you are minoring or majoring in Spanish, you would be doing yourself a disservice not to take a class with him at some point.", 
            "Best Spanish professor I've ever had. Period. I took his class as a part of the Spanish Intensive program in Alicante. The class was very intense, but Munne was always willing to help. He is a very difficult teacher, but if you are prepared to work the rewards are great. Very clear with lessons and expectations. Highly recommended!", 
            "Prof. Munne was a great teacher. I took his Spanish for Heritage speakers class and I can honestly say I got everything I wanted out of the class and more. He definitely helps you improve your spanish writing and grammar. He's a fair grader too. Overall great class!", 
            "Joan is amazing. By far the best Spanish teacher I have had here at Duke (out of 6). He asks for your participation and your commitment, but he brings it in return. Always prepared, engaged, interested and on the ball. Totally suggest a course with him.",

Charney makes the material interesting and does a great job fostering open discussions inclusive of all view points. That class helped me learn a lot about ethics and contemporary philosophy as well as my own values.",

If you value getting a once-in-a-lifetime experience of getting taught by someone as passionate and wacky as Charney over just an easy A, take his class. You'll have to work for your grade, but he makes you enjoy learning about Public Policy.",

I finished the class feeling like I had learned a ton.",

That being said, it is near impossible to get an A in this class. 50% of our final grade came down to 10 weekly quizzes that were incredibly difficult. If you need a good grade, find another professor.", 
            "I took Charney after being advised by older students who had taken his class before and praised it. Was a bit of a let down -- he's brilliant but keen on having scattered lectures and very hard grading. Him & TAs are impersonal/intimidating. However, 302's topics are definitely interesting and very useful for pubpol/government majors.",

Charney is wacky & will challenge everything you know in the best way, even if you hate him for it in the moment",

He's not politically correct and likes to say things for shock factor. We didn't have to write any memos or papers, just a quiz every week and group assignment every 2 weeks.",

The subject material is interesting in itself (we talk about prostitution, euthanasia, obesity, paternalism, utilitarianism etc.), but Charney takes this class to the next level! We have stimulating debates in class and guest lecturers. Super helpful-he holds review sessions before quizzes.",

On the other hand, you genuinely learn the thought behind the processes. Overall, he was my favorite professor 1st semester. Math at Duke is going to be hard, might as well take it with a good professor.",

He has done cool research that he incorporates into his lectures.",

He's an approachable, like-able professor and makes learning introductory biology more pleasurable. I really enjoyed the class- it was fair, well-structured, and interesting.",

In class, he never discourages wrong answers.",

The two important things about doing well in his class are thoroughly understanding his lectures and asking him questions after class.

Test questions were fair, and based more on application than rote memorization, though that was still a big part of the class."

            "Broverman is very knowledgable and passionate about what she teaches, and you learn a lot. Mostly lectures, with some case studies in between. Tests are not too hard, but you definitely have to study for them. There is also a presentation at the end. Very approachable outside of class as well. Take the class if you are interested in the topic.", 
            "she is very enthusiastic about the material but does a terrible job at teaching it. The things she discusses at length in class are barely on the test and the actual biology is just glanced over in class even though it is difficult to understand. Not worth it as an easy natural science.", 
            "The class is pretty interesting and Dr. Broverman is obviously enthusiastic about the material, but the class is somewhat unorganized. Most of the material is common sense, but the lectures were not presented in an order that made sense which was confusing. The biology in this class is pretty easy overall and very brief.", 
            "Dr. Broverman is hilarious, witty and a grade A cynic (in a good way). However, her lectures are seriously disorganized and the class itself could be structured by the TAs in a more efficient manner. This class is extremely lecture heavy, make sure you take down everything she says. Attendance is not taken but you will literally fail if you skip.", 
            "Dr. Broverman's lectures are very disorganized. What she says does not match what's on the test, so her tests are far from accurate assessments of her students. It's extremely frustrating to be in her class because the material is not difficult, but the grades students get would indicate otherwise. She doesn't teach and then tests as if she has.", 
            "I am so glad I had Prof. Broverman during my first semester here at Duke. Not only is she extremely knowledgable about global health but she also genuinely takes an interest in the lives of her students. She really puts a lot of effort into ensuring that her class and the entire Global Health FOCUS program are positive experiences for new students.", 
            "Write down everything that comes out of her mouth during lectures for tests and homework. Tests are take-home but the questions are hard + vague to the point that you won't always know what she's looking for. Participation is EXTREMELY important in this class: raise your hand to ask a BS question 3-4 times during class to get participation points.", 
            "Dr. Broverman is one of the best lecturers that I've ever had at Duke. Although her class sizes are large, she always makes you feel engaged.", 
            "Go to class and take notes; lecture slides are posted online but they're pretty vague. Plus, Broverman is a funny and engaging lecturer, which helps in remembering the material and makes going to class worthwhile. For tests, just take the practice exams and skim over your lecture notes, and you should pass without a problem.", 
            "Dr. Broverman's Global Diseases focus class is easy to do well in as long as you attend class and participate. She has interesting presentations, and if you listen and ask questions, every assignment and test is fairly easy to complete. Not a big time commitment.", 
            "Dr. Broverman is a great professor. From her FOCUS program to her AIDS class to WISER, she takes her students seriously and invests time in her relationships with them. Bio180FS was for the Global Health FOCUS, and it was a great blend of biology and global health. Would recommend Global Health FOCUS but would certainly recommend Dr. B!", 
            "Very much a \"get out what you put in\" class. Broverman is great- super knowledgeable, caring, and a great lecturer. She's a little spacey on administrative stuff. She can tell who's really invested and who's not a mile off, so don't even try with her if you don't care.", 
            "This class was pretty easy and interesting for me and some of my friends, but I had other ones who really struggled. If you're not a huge science person but you're looking for a science course to take, this is a good one. It's a huge lecture, so you don't have to show up. Grades are based on three short assignments, two midterms, and a final.", 
            "Dr. Broverman is a fantastic and knowledgeable professor. She makes the material accessible for students who don't have much Bio experience, and makes her lectures interesting with her great sense of humor. I disagree with comments about the TA's grading; there's a clear rubric by what you can see from previous exams and graded assginments", 
            "Dr. Broverman is an amazing faculty member who is doing great work however her lectures were boring. Also, the TA's are in charge of all the grading in the class and are ridiculously tough graders. There are no rubrics, which makes the situation even worse. Overall, the topic is interesting but there is little guidance and arbitrary grading.", 
            "While taking this class, I didn't understand what all the hype was about; but now that it's over, I understand. Dr. Broverman is disorganized and a confusing lecturer at times, but the material is extremely interesting, interdisciplinary, and relevant to a world where poverty and disease are the (often overlooked) norm in many places.", 
            "I heard really good things about this class from others, but I think something was off this semester because the class was just meh. The topic was really interesting and Prof. Broverman does amazing work, but the lectures were pretty disorganized and I felt the grading was too specific. Be sure to do the homework well and study for the tests.", 
            "Dr. Broverman is held in high regards by many Duke students. While the course content was interesting and important, I found Dr. Broverman's lectures mundane and aloof. It was almost as if she had taught the course so many times that she no longer had any interest in teaching it. It's an easy NS credit, but I'd take any praises with a grain of salt", 
            "She is such a bad professor. Please don't take her class. She is so disorganized and this class is the last thing on her mind. Normally, it wouldn't be a HUGE deal but the class suffers as a result of her disorganization. SO BAD. She should not be teaching.", 
            "Listen, don't take from her unless it's required. Dr. B is rude and condescending. Yes, she knows a lot, but she doesn't know how to get through to students. She can be scattered and behind. Grading takes forever and rubrics are nonexistent. Favorites in class are clear, and she can be very sarcastic."

            "awesome math teacher- obviously you shouldnt take 103 unless you really have to (like for engineering) but if you do, then Hodel is easily the best. i switched into an early morning section just to get her, and it was worth it. she is an expert", 
            "Best prof I have ever had and probably will ever have. The material in 103 is very challenging but if you need to take this class take it with her. She will always meet with to to explain something if you didn't understand it in class. She makes 103 do-able and enjoyable!",

If you have to take it, choose Prof. Hodel. She always answers questions and explains concepts as clearly as possible. Also, her sections do well on the final, which will improve your grade.", 
            "An amazing teacher. She makes one of the hardest math classes very manageable, and her explanations are clear. Don't miss class, and don't miss any of the handouts she gives, because they're invaluable. Also, she's a very nice and approachable person. She makes sure to know your name, which isn't very common of many professors!", 
            "She's not perfect (who is?), but she's the best math teacher I've ever had. Follow along in class and do the homework as she assigns it and you should be fine. She's always willing to help and is an extremely nice person. If you ask for help, she'll often make simple statements that clarify what seems to be quite confusing at times.",

My one issue wit the class was that most class time was not spent delving into the reading material, or discussing the merits of what we were learning.

Some boring reading is assigned though.",

            "Professor Komisarow is a good person with caring research goals. This class is always going to be a mediocre/bad experience for every student, but there are ways to make it better. Her communication with students and TAs was not existent, even TAs did not fully understand assignments/expectations. She does not understand students, needs practice.", 
            "Professor Komisarow is a good lecturer and seems like a nice lady. The content of this class is not very difficult. The tests are very tricky and the memos are graded incredibly arbitrarily by the TA's. Tests are not many questions, so missing three questions can amount to a C. Do not take this class if you are not sure that you want to major in PP",

            "She's not a bad teacher, definitely a helpful lecturer, but there's absolutely no communication at all. The memo grading is insanely harsh, and at the point at which she doesn't even tell you what should go in a good memo, it's hard to fix mistakes. TA's are also all over the place on grading.", 
            "Lectures are boring and pointless because she presents material with the least amount of explanation possible. There are no rubrics for memos, so it is hard to tell what she is looking for The tests have few questions and all multiple choice, so small mistakes can tank your entire grade. Only take if PUBPOL major!",

Once she didn't answer a basic question because \"she wanted to put that question on the exam.\" How are we supposed to know it if she doesn't teach it. Overall, poor communicator.", 
            "When it comes to teaching communication is the name of the game and sadly asking to clarify things is not an option.

            "Professor Komisarow is a great lecturer and professor. She always works to make sure that concepts are understood, as do the teacher assistants. However, the direction she provides for memo assignments is very vague, and she seldom is on the same page as the teacher assistants when providing direction for memos. Also, the class is hard overall.",

You just get taken points off randomly without being aware or having been warned before. Memos are tough as usual, but she doesn't necessarily help with it. Been to office hours for a memo that received F and was told it didn't seem so bad.", 
            "Honestly, she's sweet. People in my class were very aggressive and rude so the combination of the semi-hard material and clashing personalities made a terrible atmosphere. Only reason I wasn't a fan of the class was because of arbitrary grading and lack of communication between her and the TAs. Also the Sanford bell curve is trash but not her fault", 
            "Lectures were great and she explained the material clearly. But as a professor, she was quite rude and aggressive, and her grading criteria was arbitrary and inconsistent. She refuses to share her rubric with any students which I never had happen to me with a professor before. She is willing to give feedback if you manage to book an appointment", 
            "Very organized in her lectures and does has a very clear schedule of what needs to be done when. But she's anal and rude. She's got a chip on her shoulder about being a new teacher and it translates into this weird aggression towards students. This class was easy in terms of material but the grading was quite unfair", 
            "Some correlate their grade with how they like the teacher, but even though I performed well this teacher is not worth taking this class with. Individual meetings with her are great but as its a 100 kid class its unrealistic to have just that. Those of you who got meetings during the memo periods and before a test congrats but for the others :(",

I think at the end if you completed everything adequately, you got an A.",

His lectures are boring/useless but exams are easy (if you have taken AP Stats before, otherwise may be trickier and need to self-teach). Prof. Rundel is accessible outside of class and better at explaining concepts to students 1 on 1.", 
            "I know Colin gets a lot of reviews for his BioStat class, but he is perfect for STA 323 Statistical Computing. He really is an absolute expert in this field. And while his lectures are hard to keep up, he posts recordings and they are super helpful to rewatch. Incredibly practical, industry skill class. Group homework every single week.", 
            "If you have taken statistics in high school and are looking for a class where you don't have to attend lecture, this is for you! Going to lecture and not going makes no difference at all. He is decent, however, if you go to him during office hours! His class is curved at the end of the semester but no one really knows how he curves the class.", 
            "Rundel is an adequate, knowledgeable stats professor who, while lacking enthusiasm, communicates the material clearly. You have to remember that stats is simply not easy and that many students who take it are doing so because it is a requirement for their major. I can't imagine that you would have a much better experience in any other stats class.", 
            "Rundel is probably the worst professor at Duke. His lecture slides are riddled with mistakes and full of unnecessary proofs, which he wrote out on the board without ever really explaining what was happening. Even the TA didn't know how to do his homework problems sometimes, and his exams involve info not covered in lecture. Avoid at all costs!", 
            "Probably the worst professor I've had at Duke. If I could go back, I would have taken Calc 2 for the bio major instead of this. His apathy is painfully visible, and it's difficult to get through a lecture without stabbing yourself with a pencil to stay up. His tests are not straightforward and filled with mistakes. Do not take a class with him.", 
            "His lectures are extremely boring, obtuse, and convoluted. They are rarely without mistakes and even his final had mistakes on it. 10/10 would not recommend. Save you soul, save your GPA, save you chances for med school", 
            "Don't take this class. Take a different stats class, or Bio 204. You don't learn much and he goes way too fast during lectures; the whole experience was long and useless. It wasn't the hardest class I've ever taken but it was hard for no reason.", 
            "Without a doubt one of the worst professors at Duke. He makes classes long and hard. His midterms are hard, because you cannot learn from going to class.

In terms of work, 150 pages a week, 4 papers, and a final term paper. Willing to help out, but tends to be a bit unforgiving in terms of grading. Super chill dude.", 
            "Prof. Miller is a super nice guy and is very passionate about the subject. This class was a seminar with 15 people in it that met once a week for 2.5 hours. The class was very boring. You have to read 19th century Russian translations that are very long and difficult reads. A 1 page response paper every week and 3-4 page response every other week.", 
            "Professor Miller has a great deal of knowledge in the field of terrorism. Very well respected professor and a good lecturer. Assigns 4 response papers so there isn't much room to mess up, but if you get help, the essays are very manageable.", 
            "Prof. Miller is fantastic! Really knowledgeable about terrorism and everything Russia. About 150-200 pages of reading a week and a 3-4 page paper every other week. There is a final paper at the end that weighs pretty heavily, but go to office hours and he'll totally guide you. Def. a cool guy to learn from and a great professor.", 
            "Dr. Miller is an excellent professor and leads the seminar really well. Grading in this class was based entirely off of 4 papers (90%) and participation (10%). Very willing to work with his students to help them become better writers, and I felt like the papers were very manageable. We typically had around 80-120 pages of reading per week.", 
            "Professor Miller is among one of the best professors I've had here at Duke. Extraordinarily accomplished in his field and very respected. His classes are very reading-heavy, and he expect rigorous analysis in your papers. There are only 2/3 papers and a final term paper so you can't really screw them up too much. Overall, solid choice.", 
            "I find that Professor Miller is seriously underrated on this site. If you're a serious scholar of History, you will enjoy studying with Dr. Miller. He is immensely knowledgeable and always responds when you need help. I have taken three of his classes.", 
            "Professor Miller is a fantastic professor. I took 279 and 278, which were a lot of reading but worth the grind. He is demanding, but Professor Miller is such an interesting guy that his courses are worth taking even if you're not a history major. I can genuinely say Modern Terrorism was the best course I have taken at Duke thus far (I am a Junior).",

He has a laid back attitude toward lateness and class participation, but at the same time you can tell he loves the material and really wants to learn from the students. The class isn't easy and you will have to work, but that's how it should be.", 
            "Very interesting guy. His lectures actually held my attention. There is little to no class participation, though - it is all lecture. That is fine by me, but might bother others. Level of difficulty all depends on his TA, who grades the tests. However, I appreciated that he offered an extra credit paper and that the final was take home.",

The class really taught me the basis of systems theory and provided me with skills in technical writing and data visualization. This is not a class you can sit passively and get through, and you really get out of it what you put into it.", 
            "Dr. Golden's expertise in sustainability clearly stands out, and he is dedicated to student success with course material and career goals. Your ability to analyze decisions with high-level, systems-thinking will increase, and the memos you write will enhance your research and technical writing skills. Very rewarding class, highly recommend.", 
            "Definitely one of the harder classes but he does a great job of preparing you for a career in the environmental management field. Technical writing is really tough but when you look back it helps you so much in your job. Provides great real world examples based on his experiences with many of the worlds largest companies and governments", 
            "Provides practical understanding and application of work", 
            "Jay always showed flexibility and willingness to listen to feedback as he was developing his course. He frequently brought in outside speakers that provided helpful context on where the subject matter linked to real-world applications. He helps develop a systems-thinking approach that's useful across a number of fields. I'd take the course again.", 
            "Excellent introduction to the theory and practice of life cycle assessment. Dr. Golden usefully structures the class to provide hands on exposure to industry software tools and real-world projects. A great starting point for future practitioners and will allow generalists to understand and speak to this cornerstone of environmental analysis.", 
            "Dr. Golden is an industry and academic veteran in sustainability, and brings this expertise to the course, offering a strong framework to contextualize CSR as well as connections for real world projects and networking opportunities. The material is quite comprehensive and rigorous. For the motivated student, it will be a rewarding experience.", 
            "Jay Golden is a teacher that makes you want to learn. The class was not easy in that he has incredibly high expectation of you and your teams. However, his classes were the most rewarding because I learned and did the most. The client projects helped me get a job because they proved to employers I could perform in the real-world.", 
            "Dr. Golden is an amazing teacher! He will never give you a straight answer but he always directs you towards the resources needed to find your answer. He treats you just as a boss treats an employee. He wants you to succeed but he isn't about to roll over and do all the thinking for you. And he tells you that right away.", 
            "The theory of LCA was taught in a very clear, straight-forward manner. However, the practical hands-on aspect of the class, where we learned how to use the LCA software, was often times very confusing. Dr. Golden is available outside of class to review the material, but it's up to you to actively ask for the help. Also, be prepared for group work!", 
            "This class was a great introduction to sustainable systems thinking from a business perspective, and the guest speakers Dr. Golden brought into class were very helpful with connecting our in-class learning to the real happenings of the industry. A large part of the workload consists of writing professional memos which is a good skill to have.", 
            "Dr. Golden is best known for his dedication to his students and his support of their personal and career development. Highly recommended.", 
            "This is a super helpful skill to have if you want to go on to work in corporate or product sustainability. Be ready to actually build that skill, though - lab exercises are important to keep on top of in this class so that you understand the lecture content and software tools. Very happy I took this class and now understand LCA processes and data!", 
            "Very interdisciplinary class which makes it both interesting and challenging. Bring your thinking caps, as a big part of the class is analyzing macro-trends and applying them to real-world situations. Lots of group projects, which can be a plus or a minus depending on your team. All in all, very helpful class that helped inform my career interests!"

            "Professor Goodacre is very engaging and his love of the subject is clear to students. He genuinely enjoys teaching and is understanding of students' needs. You'll need to do some reading outside of class, but not excessively, and the weekly \"quizzes\" are a nice way to stay on top of everything.", 
            "Goodacre is a great lecturer. He is also hilarious. All of his classes have the same format (online quizzes due every class, 2 7-8 page papers). He is the very best in his field. He's on so many histor channel documentaries. If you are interested in analyzing the Bible then Goodacre is for you.", 
            "One of the greats. Made the class super interesting and fun, and I learned a ton. The class met once per week for 2.5 hours, but he makes it feel shorter than a normal class. Reasonable amount of work and reasonable expectations. He really is an amazing professor.", 
            "Goodacre is an incredible professor -- made New Testament super interesting and wasn't hard to do well in this class. Work hard on the professors and reach out to TAs, do the daily quizzes and you'll be fine. Sign in sheets during class but you aren't penalized for attendance -- just get to drop two quizzes if your attendance is good.", 
            "Goodacre is incredible smart, funny and sweet! Take his classes!!!!!! All of them!", 
            "Professor Goodacre is fantastic all the way around - an impressive intellectual, having done all of his education at Oxford, a leader in his field, and charismatic and engaging in lectures. I learned so much in this class about St. Paul, Scripture, and early Church history, not to mention just reading Scripture for hw is pretty cool. A must take.", 
            "Very easy class. skipped most lectures and got an A. Goodacre himself is a very interesting lecturer and made the class enjoyable, I just skipped to prioritize other things", 
            "A great guy. Absolutely willing to help. Considerate of student's schedules and stresses. You have to work but you feel good about doing the work because he's such a great guy.", 
            "Awesome teacher. Fun class. Would love to have him again. Easy too.", 
            "Professor Goodacre is an awesome teacher. Not only is his British accent great to listen to, but he is funny and very supportive of his students. His New Testament class is very straightforward - he gives out lecture notes before every class and you will always know what is going on. I highly recommend him!!", 
            "Goodacre's a great lecturer. He presents his views on issues and the opposing views, then allows us the final decision. A note to Christians who don't have a background in scholarly New Testament study: you'll learn things in here that you never did in church. Some may challenge your beliefs! But it's worth it \u2013 you'll learn so much in the process!", 
            "took non-canonical with him. Great man with a great sense of humor. Loved his class. No that's an understatement. LOVED HIS CLASS. Cap's prolly don't help explain the situation. Put it this way, he's just an amazing professor . The question is, why not take all his classes: Historical Jesus, New Testament, Life and Letters of Paul, and NonCanon?", 
            "I love this guy.", 
            "Goodacre is the cutest man. Interesting to listen to and truly cares about his students. There are quizzes after every class which are pretty straightforward and three papers. Would definitely recommend this class!!", 
            "Professor Goodacre is a fine lecturer and has a knack for creating interesting aspects and bringing them into history which would be otherwise mundane. He is friendly in office hours and very cheerful, and his quizzes are not difficult. Essays in his class may be a bit difficult, so it is best to stick to the sources given and work from there.", 
            "This guy is awesome. He's hilarious and spends 30 minutes of the class showing videos, telling interesting stories, and telling jokes. Students get a 5 minute break halfway through, too. Still, you're guaranteed to learn a ton and have a great time. Very, very little work, but don't forget to take the quizzes after class!", 
            "Prof Goodacre had a keen sense of humor so his lectures were very interesting. You don't have to study outside of class at all. However, there were 2 6-paged essays and an online final that will constitute 70% of your grade. Make sure to do WELL on those & you'll be fine.", 
            "Extremely knowledgeable about the subject, fair grader, adorable accent. TAKE HIS CLASS.", 
            "Easily one of my favorite professors at Duke. I honestly wish I had time before I graduate to take more of his classes. LOVED this class and every thing about him. He's hilarious, charming, and makes the material so exciting to learn. I looked forward to going to this class, which is weird since it was at 10:05. LOVE HIM!"

            "One day, a graduate TA showed up to teach in her stead. It was this day I realized how incredible she is.", 
            "Worked with her on an out-of-class. She was extremely dedicated, caring and went the extra mile to help the team succeed.", 
            "Took Econ 210 with her - hands down best Econ professor at Duke, especially for a large core class. Lectures were crystal clear, and she kept the material interesting. 10 problem sets, a midterm, and a final - go to class, listen to the lectures, and you'll do well. Extremely fair class, and I would take her again if she taught an elective.", 
            "Dr. Connolly is simply AMAZING. She is extremely intelligent, thoughtful, understanding and caring. She is fantastic not only as a professor, but also as a mentor and advisor. Her passion for Economics is evident and infectious! Definitely one of the highlights of my Duke experience and I would repeat it all over again :)", 
            "Michelle is one of the best professors I've had - her thesis class is chill, but you learn a ton about how to write, your topic, and your classmates' topics. The in-class problem solving was intellectually stimulating and fun, and also super helpful for refining your topic and getting help. It's clear that Michelle cares deeply about her students!", 
            "Michelle is a very inspirational economics professor, arguably the best at Duke. I took her EC495 and EC496 thesis workshop and she gives the most awesome feedback. Plus, we even have some of our classes off campus, like at Cocoa Cinnamon, which was pretty cool. Take her class!", 
            "Probably the best lecturer in the econ department - and I've taken a LOT of econ classes. Doesn't really use the textbook so going to class is a must - but you will enjoy it eventually. Grading policy is clear and lenient and the curve is pretty decent. Judging by my rank, at least 35% of the class got an A or A+.", 
            "Connolly was an okay lecturer at times but she seems to delight in a chilly apathy for the class and students. She often smirks while reminding you that she bizarrely won't answer any questions relating to the problem sets. Her material is somewhat simple, but the fact that she has no posted notes or lectures is frustrating.", 
            "one of the best econ profs i've had. the best prof among the core econ classes (101, 201, etc..), in my opinion even better and more engaging than nechyba. she keeps class engaged and interesting, and her lectures are crystal clear. she's really patient in explaining and making sure everyone gets it", 
            "chill and smart, very flexible for thesis but will provide a ton of advice/help if needed.", 
            "Connolly is a great professor. It is easy to get an A, here tests are easy, and there is also a huge curve. Her style of lecturing is interesting. There isn't an emphasis on reading textbook, but reading it helps. The final was a bit random in that she pulled 30% from material that was irrelevant to the crux of the course. Easy class", 
            "Great professor and genuinely cares about her students. To people complaining about her curving Econ 110 to a C+, the other professors curve the class to a C. It's easy to see why you did poorly in the class if you don't understand the concept of replacement value by now.", 
            "One of the best professors at Duke. She looks serious but the classes are really fun! Best way to enjoy Macroeconomics!", 
            "Great teacher, not hard. Easier core. I enjoyed", 
            "Connolly really is a good prof. Her lectures build on theory, and the problem sets are suppose to be more applicable. The problem sets can be vague, but she usually gets strong TAs which help clear up and reinforce the theory in class. She's fair, clear, and keeps class moving. Will work with students outside of class with their goals too.", 
            "Professor Connolly was very clear and presented the material in a coherent manner. I was not a fan of how students were encouraged to participate (grade booster for participating) because this often times encouraged people to ask questions that were off topic, just so that they would be speaking in class. Overall a great teacher and good class.", 
            "I can see both sides to the Connolly argument. I loved her and thought she was a great teacher, but I also attended lectures regularly and kept up with the pace of the class which is extremely important! Lectures build on each other so it can be easy to get behind and then its all downhill.", 
            "I wasn't thrilled with the class, but I think that was because the material got to be too much. Connolly herself is fairly clear, tries hard to keep the class listening, gave a generous curve, and genuinely cares about the students. I've taken five classes in the Economics department and Connolly is easily the best Econ teacher I've had so far.", 
            "Just to get the record straight, for those who care... Professor Connolly presents the material in the most clear way. Anyone (seriously) attending her class can vouch for that. She is extremely helpful and definitively knows her stuff. Bottom line: some people lack the ability to recognize an excellent teacher. Their loss..."

I am surprised I passed.",

She made what could be a boring class interesting by varying the activities and ways we engaged with the material. Very accessible outside of class. Quizzes and midterms/finals are fine if you prepare well.", 
            "Graciela is by far the best professor the Spanish department has to offer. She is a fair grader and gives excellent feedback on written assignments. Spanish 301 is structured by the department as a whole, but she does a good job of making it manageable and interesting. She has clear expectations and wants students to learn and succeed.", 
            "Graciela's rating on here is very unfair/not reflective of her whatsoever. I had her for both 204 and 301, and she's been one of my favorite professors at Duke. She cares a lot about her students, and if you get to know her is very nice and funny. Gives great feedback on papers and assignments, and her expectations are very clear. Very fair grader", 
            "Gets a bad rep but if you try your best, she'll definitely see that and will help you out. She wants to see you succeed and understands that Spanish at Duke isn't the easiest. Nothing really surprising on the quizzes or tests, bad grades are more attributed towards the students not giving effort. You have to work for your grade here.", 
            "Professor Vidal is so understanding and sympathetic of how brutal the spanish language program is at Duke. She tries her best to deal with a class that basically sets you up to fail. If you have to take SPAN204, Vidal is the way to go. She isn't soft though, she expects you to show up and show effort. Never going to blatantly fail you on orals.", 
            "I really liked Vidal. She was very helpful outside of class and gave good feedback. Grading did seem arbitrary at times and expectations on some projects were unclear. This class is a lot of outside work. I found it comparable to Orgo in terms of work load, but it's not terribly hard and Vidal was very helpful.",

            "Her class on Latin American Dictatorships was very interesting but focused only on Argentina. She stressed cultural analysis, but no one knew what that meant or what she wanted exactly so it felt like we were going in circles. However, she's very nice and a fair grader. I would take another class of hers again.", 
            "I love Prof. Vidal! She's great, super understanding. She tries to make the class interesting, even with somewhat dry material. Some people think that she is abrasive, but if you chat with her a little one on one you'll see how nice she is. You should definitely give her a chance! :)",

Her impression of the student is as much as a determiniate in the grading process as is the effort and accomplishments on the other end.",

Sometimes isn't clear about what the homework is. Will correct your grammar mistakes when you speak in class but doesn't make you feel bad about them.",

But Grimes gives study guides before exams, and if you do everything on them, you should get an A. Also, she gave us \"pop\" quizzes in class, but went over them in class and let us change our answers (aka completion points). Go Grimes!",

I stopped going to class, and instead started reading from the book. By reading the book carefully before exams, I ended up pulling an A (just barely). It's not an easy A - but it's definitely attainable.",

I think an intro psych course doesn't lend itself to being super exciting and Dr. Grimes's lectures didn't help, but her passion was obvious and I did learn a few interesting things.",

Do show up to class, because she often puts things straight from the slides on the tests. Tests aren't too difficult if you are good at memorization, but you do have to put in some work to get an A.",

            "I really enjoyed Psych 101 and think Prof. Grimes is awesome (flunch her, she's really cool). I have to say though, Psych gets a rep for being an easy A, and it's not. It's an easy B, but there's a LOT of material (all very straightforward, though) that gets covered very quickly and you definitely need to study a lot. I'd say it's an attainable A",

            "I love this class! Dr. Grimes is really nice and caring. Lecture is usually interesting and she does fun demonstrations. First test was too picky but she gave credit if too many students missed a question. Attendance at discussion section is required, not always worth it though.", 
            "Lecture goes like this: \"I mean, what do you really need to know about _________. I'm sure you guys all know this already. It's in your textbooks. You read this. Oh, this is a cool video. I'm not going to show it to you now. You can watch it on your own time later on. OK next slide.\" Repeat for 75 minutes.", 
            "Dr. Grimes was great, really nice, very fair. One of my favorite classes so far. Attendance was required but she made class interesting. Grade based on tests (do the readings and take notes in class), assignments that were actually worthwhile, and participation. The course (Adolescence) is a service learning course too, a great experience."

She was often unclear or the expectations for the class, which reflected when a majority of us did very poor on the exams and she was upset. During office hours she was GREAT though. I wish her lectures were more like the intimate office hours setting.", 
            "I had Delene for Biostats last spring. My biggest critique is that the class was poorly organized and often times were confused as to what was expected from us. Dalene, was sweet and willing to meet outside of class and was especially helpful at office hours. She even bought Monuts for our last exam office hours. Final exam was a data project.", 
            "Professor Stangl is definitely a sweet person. That being said, she should NOT be teaching an entry-level statistics course. I took AP Stats in High School and she managed to confuse me on topics I had already learned. You'll be better off just taking Stats 101 with a different prof, it's the same class as 102.", 
            "Not a very clear professor. Class is required and there are random homeworks and projects interspersed throughout the semester. Don't recommend.", 
            "One of the worst teachers I've ever had. Not very clear at explaining anything but willing to spend SOOO much time to try to help you, and not succeed in the end.", 
            "Dalene was one of the best teachers that I have had a Duke. Yes her class was difficult but she is super passionate and challenged us to think about statistics in a new way. If you took AP stat in high school you may be at a disadvantage because the way she wants you to think about Statistics is different than other teachers generally teach.", 
            "This class expects you to learn material beforehand and apply it in class. If you have a good background in stats 101, this class will be fine, but otherwise you'll have to work for it. Dr. Stangl is a tough grader, and her tests don't always match up with what we do in class, but her office hours are very helpful, as are her in-class assignments.", 
            "She doesn't lecture. You're expected to read and understand all the material by yourself and then come to class prepared to do group work. This system doesn't make sense and it's very confusing. She is also very disorganized.",

Every negative comment on this page is true and I wish I had read this before taking this class, as I now find myself considering withdrawing to avoid her.",

            "Prof. Stangl is a great person. As a teacher, I don't quite follow her logic. Most of our lectures are presentations from Bass Connections, and we rarely go over stats material, which is what the tests consist of. The projects are fairly easy, but time consuming, as stats should be. It isn't the worst experience with Stangl, but not the best.", 
            "She has the most annoying voice ever. Not to mention she is just mean and not helpful. She thinks she is but her lack of clarity makes her useless as a teacher. Do not ignore all the RMP ratings", 
            "Worst teacher I have ever had. She always changes her mind on what she wants and expects us to read her mind. She is super condescending and has no idea how to teach. DO NOT TAKE HER. You will regret it.", 
            "She is a super nice woman, but she is honestly one of the most confusing teachers I have ever had. She is focused on concepts, and that would be fine if she ACTUALLY EXPLAINED THE CONCEPT. Tests and quizzes come out of nowhere and are nothing like what you have practiced--the book assessments are on nothing found in the book. Avoid if possible.",

            "Prof Stangl is a nice woman, but a confusing teacher. The expectations for the course were never clear and the tests were confusing and never what was expected. Her philosophy is interesting, but she goes a little too far with the idea of knowing concepts and not specifics. Therefore it is hard to know what will be tested and how to study.",

The material for this course was not super super challenging, but the tests are graded out of few points so if you get one question wrong it can affect your overall grade by a lot.", 
            "An ideal professor. I struggled with this course but he was very accessible and helpful at office hours, and in lectures he was super engaging and excited to tell you about his field. He gives you everything he can to help you succeed.", 
            "Excellent professor and class. Great lecturer and also posts very useful R scripts. Clear grading criteria, very helpful in office hours, and also teaches very important/useful real-life skills about regression. I definitely recommend taking STA210 with Prof. Reiter.", 
            "Grade is composed of 35% homework, 50% tests, and 15% final project. Tests are very short, but missing one part of a problem will hurt your grade by 10%. The median was in the 70's for both tests. Reiter is a very energetic lecturer, but a lot of the material can be learned by reading the slides and going over the scripts covered in class.",

He is always willing to talk to students outside of class and treats everyone equally, regardless of whether you are doing the major or not. Lecture is extremely engaging and fun. With him, it's hard not to do well as long as you have the interest and stamina.", 
            "Reiter is always very enthusiastic, and he really tried to make things interesting, but the subject of surveys in general was just not very fascinating for me. Definitely don't take this class if you are more interesting in statistical modeling. If you have a solid foundation in basic probabilitystatistics though, it should be a relatively easy A.", 
            "Took this 2 years ago, one of the best classes I've taken at Duke. You learn to code in R (bit of a learning curve at first for everyone, so expect to put in time in the course) and you learn how to analyze data. The class is great at pairing lecture and examples, including examples with code and R output in lecture. Very energetic . Very nice.", 
            "WORST CLASS! Do not take a class with Reiter: you are guaranteed not to learn. He drowns you in meaningless assignments then destroys your grade with impossible exams. Absolutely do not take a class with him unless you don't mind losing your sanity.", 
            "Reiter is very peppy, which makes people think he's a good professor. But he doesn't actually teach, so I'm confused why his ratings are so positive. Everything is out of class as students work on homework assignments that usually take over ten hours to complete. Not worth the time.", 
            "Dr. Reiter has a fundamental disconnect with the intellectual level of his students. His lectures are very difficult to follow and he provides no background information on complex ideas. I hardly learned anything and got a bad grade to boot.", 
            "Very practical class, but also very time consuming. Not conceptually hard but hw is a lot of work. Reiter is a wonderful teacher - super smart, funny, helpful, and attractive. The class will not be easy, but you will learn a lot and have the privilege to look at his beautiful face twice a week. Definitely recommend if you're willing to do the work.", 
            "One of the best professors I've had at Duke. His approach to statistics is laid back and thoughtful, instead of being formulaic. He explains the concepts behind the material, instead of just telling you how to do it--he wants you to think about how stats applies to the real world. Office hours are incredibly helpful, too.", 
            "Dr. Reiter is a truly wonderful professor! He is extremely helpful and his tests/grading are very fair. I highly recommend this professor for stat 101! P.S. I think he's hot :)",

            "While Prof Reiter is enthusiastic and helpful, his teaching leaves much to be desired. He is unclear, and his lectures are completely useless.

His lectures are fuzzy and often out of order and hard to synthesize/correlate information with the book. He gives basically no partial credit on tests. No office hours and extremely unhelpful when asked for advice/clarification.", 
            "Amazing class. I love Widenhoefer as a professor, his straightforward demeanor and dry humor make his class genuinely enjoyable. Although he can be a bit dull at times, I have absolutely no complaints. There aren't any surprises on the tests either. Show up to his lecture and you will do well. He rocks!!! Go Ross!!", 
            "Prof. Widenhoefer is incredibly intelligent when it comes to orgo, and that certainly comes through in his lectures. Tests are reasonable (with averages around 70%), and previous years' exams are on Sakai. I rarely used the textbook, as lecture provided most of the necessary information. The only time he holds office hours is the week of exams.", 
            "Organic chem is never a breeze, but Prof. Widenhofer made it straightforward by giving excellent, clear lectures and then testing fairly on the material he had lectured on. No wonky \"figure out how to synthesize penicillin from gasoline\" problems here.",

            "Really amazing lecturer, tests are fair and curved.", 
            "Widenhoefer is a fantastic lecturer and managed to make an extremely difficult subject understandable. His tests are tough (not too much partial credit) but he makes it pretty clear what he expects you to know and provides tons of practice tests which help a lot. Plus he's an amusing sort of quirky which made class entertaining.", 
            "He's an awesome teacher. The material is hard, but if you go to lecture and studies the problem he gives, you'll do fine.",

Previous tests and solutions as well as attending lecture are very useful for this class (although lecture attendance is not required).", 
            "Great lecturer. Explains everything clearly and lectures are easy to follow. He does cover some things that aren't in the book. Tests are all completely doable.", 
            "Very clear lecturer, made a supposedly difficult class unexpectedly easy. Relied entirely on notes from class and didn't need the book at all. Overall a great and relaxing class.",

Widenhoefer may not be the most outgoing guy in the world, but lectures are very clear and straightforward, and as long as you study from lecture notes and understand the mechanisms (just knowing them is not enough), you should be fine.",

He is unintentionally very funny, though he does throw a few subtle jokes here and there. You don't really need the textbook if you take good notes. He provides all of his old exams on Sakai.",

            "His tests are very straightforward. The best way to do well in his class is to take really good notes during lecture and refresh your memory on them the day before the exam. You only need to do the suggested problems. Lectures can be boring - find ways to entertain yourself. He has interesting quirks. Keep a list.", 
            "Very tough. Tests are hard, and partial credit is hard to come by. Also very boring in lecture, doesn't particularly have any interest in his students, and certainly isn't going to waste his time trying to help you. I loved orgo until this class.", 
            "He is not a very accessible man outside of his class, but his lectures are very clear and straighforward. You cannot do the mechanisms enough before each exam. practice practice practice, one wrong arrow can cost you 10/15 points! And do the old exams, as maaaany as you can get your hands on beyond blackboard or sakai",

She can be gruff with students in lecture, but is generally approachable.",

            "the best teacher I've ever had and likely will have, she's incredibly caring, inspirational, and a great human overall. she really tries to help the students that she likes, and she's especially empowering for women! love her", 
            "Great professor, really passionate about the class and the field. You have to work for your grade but if you put in the time you'll be fine", 
            "Dr. Simmons is a truly wonderful professor who shows a very deep caring for her students and their success beyond her class. She is very willing to help with connections into the work force if you share your interests with her. The midterms are very manageable if you study, and going to office hours will change your life on the labs.", 
            "Very sweet and genuinely cares about her students. Her lectures can sometimes be a bit meandering sometimes but she does her best to engage with her students. Lectures are optional, and everything is in the textbooks, but the doing the labs are a must if you want to pass (though you don't have to do most in your lab section).", 
            "EGR103 is pretty easy; you don't have to go to the lectures if you read the book on your own, but the lecture is not boring. Dr. Simmons is a very caring professor. Most of the labs are optional though-finished them on the bed of my dorm.", 
            "Lectures can be kind of boring and not helpful since all materials can be found in the textbooks and during labs. However she calls on people randomly for participation so watch out!", 
            "Though I had Mrs. Dr. Simmons for EGR103, what was really important for this class was the labs. Skip Dr. G's labs and you won't pass- skip class and as long as you study on your own you'll be fine. Dr. Simmon's method of teaching is a bit frantic but she gets her point across. All in all a fairly easy class if you do the labs.", 
            "This is a design based class and expect to not get grades back for weeks at a time.", 
            "Her EGR103 lectures were not helpful at all, although I'll admit it may be difficult to lecture on coding. I learned everything in lab. She is a really great person though, very approachable and helped me some outside of class. If you can, I'd take the class with Dr. Gustafson (or just go to his lectures instead). Do the labs to learn it!!", 
            "She cares about all her students. The midterms were easy.", 
            "Dr. Simmons is one of the most genuine and kind professors that I have encountered. She was always willing to set aside time for students to discuss EGR103 as well as general questions about engineering and life. She is a great person to get to know and have as a professor.", 
            "Dr. Simmons is one of the best professors I've had at Duke. I flunched her last semester and had so much fun opening up to her about my life. She genuinely cares for her students and reminds me of some of my high school teachers. Though her lectures can be confusing and tests are tough, she makes up for it with her caring nature. GO TO OFFICE HOURS", 
            "Dr. Simmons can confuse herself sometimes during lectures, but she is clearly very passionate and wants to help her students in every way she can (i.e. GO TO OFFICE HOURS! REALLY!). She makes up for her mediocre lecture skills with her love for her students, and the effort she puts in.", 
            "Dr. Simmons is great one on one but can be unclear sometimes during lecture. She's a very enthusiastic teacher and cares about each student.", 
            "Dr. Simmons is very nice, funny, and interested in helping you succeed. She does her best to keep things interesting, though her lectures can be a little unclear at times. Most of the learning comes from practice with the labs, which are very helpful", 
            "She's is a passionate teacher and very kind. Dr. G is probably the better lecturer, but Simmons is amazing one on one. Its a boring class due to the subject matter and the labs are killer. Visit her office if you're struggling, it helps a ton!", 
            "She's a really nice person but Dr. Gustafson is much better at conveying concepts and staying on topic."

            "MacPhail is very nice and wants you to succeed. Lectures helped me understand the book. Team based learning only works well if you have an engaged team, but doing applications as a team does help you learn concepts yourself. Nothing is weighted too heavily so if one category is low, you can still do well. Tests are straightforward, lab is not bad.", 
            "lectures really aren't useful so don't bother going to those. instead read the book and do the practice tests he gives you on sakai. go to his office hours before the final. he makes you think that you're going to do worse than you think and is actually very generous with curving the class. i failed a midterm and still got an A", 
            "He Is a nice, very accessible teacher. He makes an effort to help the students and clarify the tough concepts. Chemistry is confusing in and of itself, and the fact that it's a flipped class makes the course harder, but he tries to help the students and he is fair.", 
            "McPhail's lectures are confusing, at least for me (my class was reversed classroom). Better to skip the lecture and read the book, paying attention to the small rules and quirks about topics. Attendance for the applications is required if you want to pass. The tests are pretty tricky too, but if you take SAGE and go into office hours, you'll be ok.", 
            "His lectures were very ehh. He doesn't make things as clear as Roy does, but that may be because his chapters for the class made less sense to me in general. He's a very nice teacher though and is very available outside of class.", 
            "he teaches the more math-y parts of chem 101, so his lectures are inherently a little painstaking to listen to. but he drops in some jokes and i think he makes an actual effort to make the lectures and class enjoyable. :-)", 
            "Not as great a lecturer as Roy, and his handwriting on the chalkboard is hard to read. He writes easier exams than Roy, but you still have to read the textbook if you want to have any idea what's going on in class.", 
            "For me, reading the textbook before class was a must. I got the most out of MacPhail's lectures by taking notes beforehand and then just listening to him talk and watching him do examples. His exam questions are pretty straightforward, but make sure you can reliably do computations so as not to lose easy points.", 
            "His lectures are fine. I preferred just reading the textbook and doing the unit plan. He was nice and accessible outside of class", 
            "Professor MacPhail is my favorite professor I've ever had. His name may be MacPhail but if you think hard about chemistry then you will DEF McPass this class!!", 
            "Dr. MacPhail is so responsible. His lectures can get intense, and maybe boring for other students, but they're great for anyone who actually cares about chemistry. He clearly loves his subject and is always willing to explain confusion outside of class. Friendly man, great class. Take it if you care about Chem.", 
            "Never fear, you can MacPass in Dr MacPhails class if you put in the effort. I actually preferred him over Roy. Hes to the point, but maintains a sense of humor. He has long hippie hair, probably because he went to Oberlin, but dont let that fool you. Hes a smart man.",

            "Dr. MacPhail sometimes co-teaches the class with Dr. Roy, which can be a bit confusing because their teaching styles differ. He gives you examples instead of explaining what's happening and why. The tests are difficult and the Sapling doesn't help much. The labs were simple most of the time and didn't really have anything to do with the lecture.", 
            "Dr. MacPhail oversaw this lab course, and he graded some of the writing assignments. Grading criteria were somewhat clear, but could have been clearer.",

            "Dr. MacPhail is a really smart guy; however, he moves very fast and lectures are usually hard to follow. I enjoyed Roy more. MacPhail just does not seem to understand that some students do not know the material and need actual explanation. He is a pretty nice guy, but I would definitely read the textbook before class.",

            "As a person Warren is pretty nice and willing to answer questions. But his written problem sets and his tests are INSANE!!! (nothing like the notes or homework assignments). Does not feel like a general chem class at all. Besides chemistry, make sure you are very good at physics.", 
            "Warren Sidney Warren is the most bestest, most interesting chem professor ever. If you like to learn, and if you enjoy science and being challenged by the concepts introduced in lecture, you will love Warren. Almost everyone I know loved Warren, was okay with Craig and then hated McPhail and Lyle for 22.", 
            "Second worst teacher I've ever had. Blabs on about things that don't matter, no study time to grade correlation whatsoever. TA's admit that tests are more about guessing than chemistry, and awful personality. Just awful.", 
            "Don't understand why everyone hates him. He's not a bad guy and will always help you outside of class. His lectures are boring, but honestly, no one can really give 'exciting' chem 21 lectures",

Plus he is pretty helpful in office hours and he is definitely a genius. I would take the class again. I don't know why everyone hates Warren.", 
            "The class was honestly not that hard. The lectures were often pointless/useless and I and most people I knew never went subsequently but as long as you read the book and do the problems the material is not that hard. Not to mention the tests are ridiculously curved, with the curve all you needed to get was about a 60 on the test for an A.", 
            "I do not agree with the previous post at all. The class was ridiculously difficult. The tests were insane, and very few people did very well. The exam written by Warren Warren was the hardest test I've ever taken in my life. It will blow your mind.", 
            "The other posts seem kind of ridiculous. This was the easiest class I took my first semester at Duke. Not a lot of work, just read the textbook before the tests and you'll be fine. Some of the test questions could have different answers depending on how you think about them, but in the end it doesn't really end up mattering. Warrens a good guy too.", 
            "Warren is really arrogant and an awful lecturer. I fell asleep more times than I can count. You don't really need to go to the lecture, just read the book and do the eduspace problems. It's an intro class, so its really not that hard.", 
            "Worst professor of my life. He is obviously a genius in chemistry, but he cannot and should not teach an intro level chem. he just knows too much, and his pompous self can't explain anything clearly. I dropped this class. best day of my life.", 
            "Class is absolutely impossible. It makes no difference if you go to lectures cause you'll still fail the test. Warren is a RIDICULOUS teacher that should have just stayed at Princeton. This class is IMPOSSIBLE -- go to the recitations, that's your only chance of doing well.",

Second, he speaks very clearly and will help you in office hours. It's true that his lectures don't review problems on the test, but links and practice tests help.",

It's true, though, that he's a genius and probably should be teaching upper-level chem rather than an introductory freshman class.

Fullenkamp is very smart and definitely one of the coolest professors I've had. This is kind of a weed-out class but you can definitely do well if you put in work.",

Lots of worked b/c of flipped classroom, but you will learn a ton of useful econ. Tests are hard and everyone fails but just do better than everyone else. The 2 weeks off in October is nice. Go to TA office hours!",

The workload is immense since it is a flipped classroom, and the problem sets consume a lot of time. Classes are spent doing problems instead of teaching. Overall, it is a very demanding class, but definitely worth taking.",

            "Dr. Wang was ok. I didn't actually go to many of the classes and instead only read the textbook and ended up doing fine. The tests were mostly reasonable, and I think if you really put in effort you'll do well. But if you're unsure of first semester orgo, it's better to wait until the spring with Baldwin or Canelas.", 
            "Orgo with Qiu is really not that bad. It's tough, yes. But if you do the textbook reading and really keep up with the work then you will do well for sure. She is very knowledgeable and her office hours definitely clarified her at times fast paced lectures. Although the class was difficult, it made 202 with Widenhoefer an absolute breeze.", 
            "Don't let anyone here scare you too much. Dr. Wang is an amazing professor. She is super sweet and extremely knowledgeable about chemistry. Her class and her tests are insanely hard, but her curves are extremely reasonable: most people got a B or above. She also prepares you extremely well for orgo 2. No regrets taking this my freshman fall.", 
            "You will definitely learn a lot of chemistry, but I don't think it's worth the trouble freshman fall. The class is already hard enough and Dr. Want makes it even harder with her emphasis on reaction mechanisms and seemingly unlikely products forming. I advise you to save yourself the trouble and take it with an easier professor.", 
            "This class was really rough honestly. The tests were really hard no matter how much you understood the material. This class literally pushed me to go to CAPS. If you want to spend your 1st semester stressing over this class, be my guest but I regretted my decision frequently throughout the semester. I did well by the skin of my teeth.", 
            "Qiu Wang is a nice person, but her class is the worst decision I have made. Please, take orgo next semester with a better teacher. The tests are insanely difficult; she would put in topics 1 or 2 chapters ahead of the current readings. We had 2 extra chapters to read compared to the other classes, and, in general, other classes had it way easier.", 
            "I really enjoyed Dr. Wangs class. She gets a bad reputation for being difficult, but if you put the work in youll see good results. Shes also a genuinely nice woman and really cares about her students. Go to office hours!", 
            "Worst experience I have ever had in my educational life. You are surrounded by ultra-competitive people on one side while getting shanked by a professor who has a ruthless grading criterion and egregiously difficult exams. Furthermore, to add salt to the wound, you get to witness the sophomores enjoying their exams with their cheat sheets. :(", 
            "Its pretty hard, especially with all the snakes in the class. However, if your last name is Du, you will Du GREAT!", 
            "Honestly, not worth taking this course at all. Just wait til spring to have a better professor. Her accent is strong and lectures are very unclear. Writes very difficult tests, usually with at least one or two questions on material that wasn't supposed to be on the test. You can tell she has exceptional chemistry knowledge, just can't teach it well", 
            "I have no idea how she is a professor. genuinely it would be better if a random sophomore taught the coarse. you won't be able to understand her speak, so lecture is useless. everyone regrets taking her class. she tries though. AVOID unless you already know orgo well somehow. just wait until next semester. don't put yourself through a nightmare", 
            "Im writing this during lecture. She is a terrible professor with unorganized lectures that are hard to follow. This class comes down to how good you are at teaching yourself from the textbook, except her tests are way harder than the textbook material. Ive never hated a class so much. Honestly, just wait until sophomore year to take orgo!", 
            "Best professor I've ever had.", 
            "Couldn't understand lectures because of accent. Taught myself all material from textbook. Seems nice but unaware. Will attempt to help students by randomly calling on them during class then make fun of them if wrong. Tests near identical to practice tests, so memorize those.", 
            "Dr. Wang taught the freshman-only section of organic chemistry during the fall. Her accent hinders understandability, but overall she is an excellent teacher. I definitely would take the class again.", 
            "If you like chemistry and are ready for a challenge, I recommend taking her class. I should note a few things: GO TO OFFICE HOURS. They were more helpful than lectures (she goes fast and it's easy to get lost), but lectures did makemore sense if you read the book beforehand. She is also very willing to take time out of her day to help her students.", 
            "Very hard to understand lectures, and writes terribly hard tests. She is nice though.", 
            "She has an accent and sometimes jumps around topics without giving detailed explanations, so teaching is not very clear. She is a sweet person, though, so if you try to approach her and ask for help, she will be there for you.", 
            "Dr. Wang is an exceptional chemist and an atrocious instructor. While she career her students, she simply doesn't have the ability to convey information to a large group. The lectures tend to be disorganized and often don't explain the content expected on the tests. You don't need to take this course first semester; just wait for the better prof.", 
            "Professor Wang is really enthusiastic about Orgo, which is great. She is also willing to help and explain things to you until you get it during office hours, but you have to put in the additional time and effort to seek out that help. Her tests are very fair but she is a harsh grader and does not reward too much partial credit."

            "Sarah Schott is the best math teacher I have EVER had! Math is the bane of my existence, but she inspired me to keep working hard at it and was always ready to help one-on-one & explain & reexplain things. She is also just an amazing person who can see the strengths & passions of her students beyond her classroom. Feel blessed to have gotten her!", 
            "SARAH IS AMAZING. YOU'RE A VERY LUCKY PERSON IF SARAH IS YOUR PROF FOR MATH. She cares so much about her students, so she always goes out of her way to help you. Though a challenging class, Sarah makes it much more bearable. Her lectures are wonderful & easy to understand. She'll go over anything until you can understand it. Srsly, best prof by far", 
            "Sarah is a phenomenal teacher. If you're taking 122 and didn't get her, it would even be worth switching to a section at 6pm if she was teaching it. The intuition she applies during lecture is unparalleled, and you will always leave class with a great grasp on the material. It's a tough course, but hard work and studying will yield good results.", 
            "Schott is truly an incredible professor. This class is difficult, but Schott is absolutely the best professor to go through it with. She is one of the most dedicated professors ever and is more than willing to always help online, over email, or during office hours. Take this class with Schott, you will not regret it - she is amazing!!!", 
            "best teach i've had at duke. her class is very challenging, but she provides so many resources and is committing to helping you understand. you really learn a lot with her. GO TO OFFICE HOURS. amazing amazing teacher", 
            "She's an amazing lecturer and makes sure everyone understand the lecture. She's definitely willing to work with you when you need help. She has hours in the help room, holds office hours, stays before and after class, and holds review sessions before tests. Her weekly problem sets were hard, but they prepare you for the midterms and final.", 
            "objectively and subjectively an extraordinary teacher. SO approachable and helpful on every level. she should win some sort of teaching award honestly", 
            "She's by far the best of the 122 teachers, and everyone loves her.", 
            "One of the best Math professors at Duke. Go to each class, takes notes, and GO TO HER OFFICE HOURS she is super helpful. Do not buy the textbook you can find it online.", 
            "Sarah is the GOAT. Take her class if you can. Literally a goddess among humans.", 
            "Sarah is an amazing professor! She is so helpful and her lecture notes are amazing. She really cares for her students and try to be as much help as possible. Would definitely recommend taking this class with her.", 
            "Amazing! Class structure & lectures incredibly well thought-out/organized. She is dedicated to helping every student. She recognizes that there are multiple approaches to problems, and tries to get on your page to help you understand. She always answered questions on Piazza & extended office hours. Hard class but she does everything to help", 
            "Would definitely recommend taking a math class with Sarah. Lectures are at a good pace and clear. She also has very helpful office hours and will work with you to figure out anything you are struggling with. Extremely nice woman and one of the best professors I have had at Duke. Class itself is somewhat challenging but not too bad with some effort.", 
            "Sarah is by far the best teacher I have had in my career as a student. I've never been particularly great at math or a fan of it, but she was helpful and made the class very doable and actually interesting. She really cares about her students and is absolutely brilliant and willing to help. 100% recommend taking a class with Sarah.", 
            "Absolutely wonderful woman and professor. By far the best math professor I've had here. Can take an extremely difficult concept and explain it in terms you can easily understand. Yeah, her tests may be difficult, but I feel that I've learned so much this semester.", 
            "Sarah is one of if not the best teacher I've ever had. Will personally meet with you to talk about anything in addition to being incredibly talented at what she does. Duke math is impossible and without her extra work I wouldn't have passed. Felt like I gained a teacher, mentor, and friend by having her. Simply amazing.", 
            "An amazing, helpful professor. Class is very tough though, with lots of work!", 
            "She's absolutely brilliant. Because of her, I loved linear algebra. She likes to teach, super clear, and stuck with the book, which I really liked. She just expanded and illuminated the book instead of presenting entirely new material, and she was always willing to answer questions. Don't forget to go to class!", 
            "Although this was the hardest class I've ever taken, Sarah is a very helpful teacher. If you have to take Calc 2, Sarah is really the only option. Very willing to meet outside of class. I was struggling the entire semester but I went to her often and I think my final grade was more of a reflection of the work she saw me put in."

            "Dr. Craig is a great professor and super enthusiastic about chemistry. Tests are based on the lectures.", 
            "Chem 110 is terrible. Don't take it if you don't have to. It's set up so that it's very hard to get a good grade and you don't learn that much.", 
            "This is a hard class, but Dr. Craig is good at explaining some of the more difficult concepts. He is patient, easygoing, and cares for his students. Beware that this is a flipped class. In my case, I often felt lost during team discussions or would have no idea as to how to start a problem. The tests aren't too hard.", 
            "Pretty difficult class, but interesting. Craig's enthusiasm is contagious. Stay on top of the learning over the weekend and you'll do well on the Monday quizzes. Try to understand the applications with help of your team. TAs are moderately helpful. Lab is very manageable only every other week and can be fun.", 
            "Quiz every Monday and it's a filpped class so get ready to lead materials over the weekend. Discussions are optional not that helpful. Lab TAs grade very easily.", 
            "The class is flipped so Craig doesn't lecture per se (only in office hours) Most in class learning is in team applications and quizzes. Craig is great at explaining concepts but sometimes he goes too far in depth.", 
            "I love this man. He is one of the most passionate professors at Duke, very kind and down to earth. The class is very application based, and for those that prefer application over memorization, it is definitely a good choice. Class isn't very hard, and he lets the class as a whole decide the weighting!", 
            "Dr. Craig is an awesome professor who wants his students to succeed. That said, the class I took with him had a \"flipped classroom\", which involved most lectures/learning done outside the classroom. His quizzes and tests were fair, if a bit difficult, and his (and TA's) in-class feedback was excellent.", 
            "His class is flipped, so prepare to watch hours of videos outside of class to understand the concepts. Aside from that, Craig is a good professor who is always willing to help if you have a question. He answers almost anything as long as it doesn't give you the answer. Very practical applications of chemistry. Take this class!", 
            "A lot of people are intimidated by the flip classroom style that Dr. Craig has but for what he teaches, I think it works really well. He's very passionate about teaching and wants his students to do well. Basically, he's awesome.", 
            "Craig is a great guy and really wants you to do well. The class is flipped so you will have to read a lot and time in class is spent taking quizzes or doing group application problems. He'll always answer questions and do his best to explain, but sometimes it gets too abstract. He has a passion for the subject, even though it's a pretty hard class", 
            "This class is flipped so Dr. Craig doesn't really teach the class much. However, I feel like when Dr. Craig does, he is a very good professor, and I honestly feel like the flipped style is beneficial because Dr. Craig is able to incorporate a lot more details and concepts, especially for orgo, that the chem 101 kids don't get.", 
            "Dr. Craig was the best professor I have ever had. He always helps by answering questions after lecture or boosting grades wherever he could. Application problems helped me learn concepts. Flipped classroom works really well. However, YOU need to take initiative. Go to class every Friday and ask questions at office hours and you will be fine!", 
            "Dr. Craig is an amazing professor and he wants everyone to understand and do well. He's one of those people who love teaching and are meant to do it. I'm not sure I'm a fan of the flipped classroom but my teammates were great to study with. Labs were a constant source of stress. Overall good class.", 
            "Dr. Craig really seems to believe in the merit of his flipped-classroom method, which I can respect. Lectures are spent either doing quizzes or team-based problem solving. I did learn a bit from my teammates, and it was probably more enjoyable than traditional lectures would have been. However, the class didn't seem worth my tuition at all.", 
            "Very effectively takes advantage of flipped classroom concept. If you're not already familiar with chem you will need to study a bit before class to get through weekly quizzes and team application problems. Class is very cooperative and problem-solving-oriented.", 
            "Lab section was more brutal than the course. Professor Craig is very cool - wish he taught us more but because the course was flipped it was truly dependent on A.) the ability of your team B.) your motivation and C.) how well you can work backwards from solution keys to the application problems.", 
            "Dr. Craig is an amazing professor who loves what he teaches. The class is flipped which was good for me since I can never stay awake during long lectures. Grading is fair and as long as you understand the team application problems you will be fine.", 
            "Best professor at duke. Extremely intelligent and approachable. Explains concepts really well and knows what you are actually asking even if sometimes you are not sure. Tests are hard but if you understand the applications you will have no problem on them. Nice guy and try a lot of ways to boost your grades up."

Boring lectures, although I imagine stats is probly pretty hard to teach in interesting way - material was basic and repetitive. TONS of homework just cause you run into bugs when coding - she's accessible anytime on Slack but can't always help so find friends in class",

Good chunk of grade is participation even though class is an 80 person lecture. Class has no CS prereqs but class very difficult w/o previous CS experience. Very infuriating class overall.", 
            "Mine does not provide clear instructions and takes off many points, only telling you after why she did so.

TA's are super nice and try to help, but Mine does not let them.",

Our homework and midterms did not have even close to clear instructions, and nobody was sure about why we lost points. You can often get the answers completely correct, but if you don't include some specific vocab word you can lose tons of points.", 
            "Labs & HW overlapped and feedback near the end of the semester was pretty scarce. Points taken off because we didn't give incredibly specific answers to questions that weren't even in the actual assignment. TAs were amazing and extremely willing to help, but they were often confused by questions that were not written well. NEED coding experience.", 
            "Seems to arbitrarily take off points on assignments for the sake of making grades lower. Feedback is way too slow . I've never had a teacher overtly attempt to brainwash her students into social justice warriors to this degree. I will say she knows her statistics though and is good at explaining concepts.", 
            "Mine unnecessarily cuts points off labs and hw. Don't be surprised if you get everything right but haven't made the fig sizes good or have more than 80 ch of code per line. The problem is we're not told what we should be doing to get all the points - no one tells us till AFTER it's too late. Getting answers to questions right is just not enough.",

She is propagandaic and tries to bring all of her belief into statistics. She actually made me think that statistics is more of a tool for people to prove their sad/bad intention.",

The assignments and material were extremely interesting, but the course takes up a lot of time - expect to spend many hours on assignments if you really want to do well.

            "A lot of comments here talk about Professor Rohde's lectures being boring, but I personally thought the information was interesting! If you're into politics remotely, you'll be fine with the information from the lectures. Tests are very manageable -- show up to class, take notes, and you should be good.", 
            "Lectures are sometimes a little dry, but you can tell that Professor Rohde is a really knowledgable, passionate person when he gets to talking about something he likes. He is really approachable outside of class. Your entire grade is basically just two midterms and a final, and all are fairly easy. You get as much out of this class as you put in.", 
            "This class was easy. Show up to lecture and take notes and you'll be fine. Only thing that is mandatory is discussion, and it's helpful for review if you don't show up to lectures.", 
            "Prof. Rohde is great. I took his American Political Systems class, and he is an expert in the field. Lecture can be a little dry sometimes. Very organized class and information.", 
            "Not sure how good the professor is. The only time I ever showed up for class is during the midterms. It is like you are taking one less course and learning material can essentially be considered a hobby.", 
            "Professor Rohde is an very interesting and knowledgeable professor. Although his lectures are fairly monotone and can sometimes be disorganized, I really enjoyed being in his class.", 
            "Really dry lecturer and gives disorganized lectures. Do the readings because you'll need examples and a clear understanding for tests and papers. Take advantage of the discussion component because that's where you'll learn the bulk of the class.", 
            "Curved the class to an A-, which wasn't bad, and there are only two midterms and a final in the class. But he's kind of a bad lecturer-- he has cool research and is clearly knowledgeable, but rambles a lot and is super monotone when he does it.", 
            "Very knowledgeable, though kind of rambly. Seminar-style, so you get what you put into it.", 
            "Rohde is a dry lecturer but super passionate and there is lots of good information, although it can be tedious and repetitive at times. Easy A if you study for the tests, show up to discussion and take notes in class - or have a friend who takes notes", 
            "Lectures were a little boring, and attendance was not taken so no real reason to go. Discussions had mandatory attendance and information was very interesting.", 
            "Very similar class to AP US and AP Gov. Rhode teaches it well but is incredibly boring. He uses no visual aids and isn't super personable. However, the class is very easy and you will learn a lot. Make sure to go to class or have a friend with good notes, as having notes are equally important as doing the reading.", 
            "Rohde is an amazing professor and an even more amazing man. Willing to entertain and add perspective to any type of question. Lectures make dry material interesting. Only way could be better is if he graded tests and papers. TAs grade pretty hard and depending which discussion you have, the discussions may uneventful. Take notes, contribute, easy A", 
            "Rohde discusses straightforward principles of politics in a straightforward way. Pay attention and you'll do well. Can be very very interesting. He's the guy who convinced me to be a PoliSci major", 
            "Heavy lecturing. You must pay attention and take notes to do well. About 100 pages of reading a week. If you do the readings, pay attention in class, and participate in the discussions, it is an easy A.", 
            "Professor Rohde is great/ he is engaging and presents the information from the perspective of a true political scientist.", 
            "Professor Rohde has a pretty dry lecturing style but for the first 2/3 of the class, he's really engaged with the material and so the students are too. The class isn't too strenuous and gives you a great intro to poli sci. He's loaded with knowledge and a really nice guy. Discussion attendance mandatory.", 
            "Dr. Rohde is at the top of his field in American political science. Although his lectures can go in circles at times, the subject matter is very interesting. Great introductory political science course where the test average is usually around an A-.", 
            "Professor Rohde is great. He's one of the top in his field and is one of the leading political scientists on the U.S. Congress. The beginning of much of this class was a review of AP Gov. Much of the class material was dry and so the lectures were as well. As long as you put in an effort, this class isn't difficult to get a good grade in.", 
            "Prod. Rohde is definitely for auditory learners because he doesn't use any visual aids which ended up being great for me. He doesn't expect too much out of you so grades come back great. Despite the easiness, he's such a wealth of information that you learn a lot."

            "Interesting class in terms of discussion. Didn't really learn anything and you can get by just skimming the reading in like 10 minutes. Pretty unclear in her grading and she'll make it clear that she doesn't like you based on your grades you get so get on her good side by being on time and participating in class", 
            "Professor Reeves is hilarious and passionate. To succeed in her class, you need to do the readings (there are a lot of them), participate in the discussions, and do well on the various writing assignments throughout the year. There are hardly any lectures. Overall, she is an accessible and fair grader, and you learn a lot in this class.", 
            "She's nice, but lectures are boring & the class is long. Necessary to do the readings in the textbook up until the midterm. If you do well on the midterm, everything else is easy as pie. Keep up with the connect modules and always write more than is expected, even if repetitive, and confidently present your final presentation. Participate in class.", 
            "Professor Reeves attempts to engage the class in a lot of discussion, but she first gives way to many readings and second, discussions can go in many different directions so if you don't know a lot about different topics it's harder to participate and harder for her to see that you are trying to participate (she also can be pretty opinionated).", 
            "Reeves presents many different topics to her students, and provides them the opportunity to explore those topics in depth during self-directed homework assignments and papers. Class discussions are always super interesting and well-directed, and there is a lot of space for students to express their own personal opinions. Definitely would recommend!", 
            "The discussions we had in class were always interesting, and she does a good job of incorporating the readings without laboriously going through every part of them. Going to see her for help before papers are due is a good idea. Would take a class from her again!", 
            "I had a great experience in Professor Reeves' class. I learned a lot and studied a bunch of interesting texts. Very much recommend.", 
            "A lot of reading, but good discussions. Helped us understand the material.", 
            "She is knowledgeable, for sure. Her style consists of open discussion with occasional note-taking, though often at surface-level. I did not get a sense of any larger \"picture\" connecting our readings. Class activities were a nice change of pace (e.g. debates, guest speakers), but also felt like an afterthought, and didn't fit into the larger class.", 
            "I really liked her class. She has a lot of business experience and shares stories about her time with big name companies. I also admire that she was a high powered woman in the business world. Grading could be a little more clear and a little more fair, but overall liked listening to lectures. Participate as much as you can", 
            "Hands down worst professor I've had at Duke. She took over Professor Grody's class due to his health issues and was not clear about grading or expectations. She has a very specific idea about what she wants to see and she's hard to please. You won't get a good grade if you don't consult her multiple times on every assignment.", 
            "While the class had great potential, it was largely a let down. Interesting subject material was analyzed through slow-paced student discussion-by-hand-raising. Grading was at times quite reasonable and at other times simply unclear. Do everyone a favor and do the reading so that the class is worth everyone's time.", 
            "There will be a lot of homework in this class. Most of the assignments are very interesting, but some are REALLY boring. Prof Reeves needs to be able to coordinates discussions in class better. She is not clear about her grading criteria and tends to grade higher leftist points of view.", 
            "Reeves is an arbitrary grader and does not engage students during lecture. Her PowerPoints are very outdated and she assigns unreasonable amounts of reading. This class has the potential to be super interesting, but sadly Reeves doesn't know how to do/doesn't care about that. Test is super specific and hard. Not worth your pain and suffering.", 
            "The trouble is fre riders on group projects. Probably can't be helped.", 
            "Professor Reeves means well, but her classes were incredibly boring and often pointless. When asked for assistance on an assignment, it feels as if she wants to be unhelpful. I will no be taking a course from her again.", 
            "Professor Reeves is one of my favorite Duke profs. She is incredibly approachable and truly interested in getting to know her students. Reeves makes textbook material engaging & relevant by bringing real world examples to each class- even sharing her personal experience in the business world. Definitely take her class!!", 
            "Prof Reeves made sense out of Friedman, Keynes, Hayek, Satz, Sen, good feed back on papers. You have to be prepared. it's worth it.", 
            "FOCUS class. Competitive to get into but worth it. smart prof, smart students (mostly). Important stuff for understanding markets. Paying off in other classes now.", 
            "Professor Reeves makes a genuine effort to get to know her students. However, she is an awful teacher who only understands course material on a superficial level. When asked a question she doesn't understand, Reeves tends to answer incorrectly or change the topic altogether. It is an easy class, albeit one I would never recommend."

            "supposed to be an \"easy A\" class--definitely possible for an A but not easy, need to study a TON for the tests or you will fail them, the material and lectures could not be more boring or dry and the studying/homework is just a nuisance. not worth it for the easy A", 
            "At first I underestimated the difficulty of the class. To get an A, just know EVERYTHING on the slides. Going to lectures does not really impact your final grade as long as you study for the tests. Extra credit pushes you up 2 whole percent points, totally clutch.", 
            "Took rocks after the reviews saying it was one of the easiest classes at Duke. Personally, I found it incredibly hard to memorize the seemingly unconnected material. Since this class isn't curved at all, DO NOT take if you aren't interested in the material and are bad at memorization compared to other Duke students. Also going to class is pointless", 
            "You can really tell that Professor Klein really enjoys what she is teaching. She is very into the subject and that shows in her lectures though they can sometimes feel pretty long. The class consists of 2 midterms, a final, and weekly homework questions. If you study the powerpoint you are set to go, though attending lecture wouldn't hurt.", 
            "Perfect combination of wonderful professor and easy class. Klein was an absolute pleasure to have. I enjoyed her enthusiasm for lectures, even though most didn't go, and I cherished how straightforward she made the class. Advice-wise, just study everything on PPTs, and try to go to lecture to absorb the material better.", 
            "Professor Klein was the clearest, sweetest professor. She's very smart but really dumbs down the material for the class. I did barely any work and was able to get a good grade. You only need to go to the review sessions before the 3 exams and memorize absolutely everything in the power points the days leading up to the exam to do well.", 
            "Easy A+. A true blessing for pre-law kids.", 
            "The class is a lot of information, but all the concepts are learnable and pretty easy. It is one of the easiest classes on campus. Klein is an incredibly smart professor who knows her stuff so well, that being said, lectures can be a bit dry.", 
            "I never showed up to class. For the last exam, I studied all the material 7 hours in advance. Literally all of it. Have fun :)", 
            "Emily Klein loves what she does. It's a pretty memorization heavy class, but you learn a lot of amazing things! Def take!", 
            "Prof. Klein is definitely the best professor I've ever had at Duke. Her exams are pretty easy and straightforward if you pay attention to her slides. Klein is also very approachable, passionate and knowledgable.", 
            "this class was harder than i thought. apparently it got harder this year because it used to be too easy. you need to memorize everything off of every slide for the tests. to put this into context, each test is around 5 chapters and each chapter has about 30+ slides. so, yea. 100s on the homework are a must because they add up too.", 
            "She's such a sweet person. The lectures are very clear, and she is always willing to help students outside of class. I recommend going to class though: it may be an easier class, but you still need to put the effort to get an A. Understanding and memorizing all the lecture slides are key for the tests. Overall, great professor.",

The PowerPoint lecture method was very effective at communicating information, and she did an amazing job simplifying tough concepts. Take good notes and pay attention in class, and tests will be a breeze. Overall, EOS 101 was one of the most informative and interesting classes I've ever taken", 
            "Loved this class and Prof Klein is great. She's always willing to meet with students and the TAs were really great. Tests are straightforward multiple choice, just make sure to put in a few hours memorizing the slides. Textbook is not necessary.", 
            "Awesome professor. Clear, energetic lecturer with a witty sense of humor and a wealth of knowledge. Keeps class interesting with anecdotes and interesting examples. Her tests are straightforward, but you must memorize EVERYTHING on EVERY powerpoint slide - if you do, you'll be just fine!", 
            "Thought this class would be much easier than it was - don't necessarily have to attend lectures, although Prof. Klein is literally the sweetest woman out there and clearly passionate about the subject. Lots of homework and even two extra credit points to add to your final grade in the end, but the tests are pretty specific and tough.",

            "Material is pretty dull, but Klein does her best to get the class through it as painlessly as possible. She posts the powerpoints on sakai. Lectures help if you find the material difficult. Tests were harder than expected so make sure to study everything on the slides! Grading criteria is very clear with three major tests and minor homework q's."

Culanth taught me a lot of useful everyday information.",

Course load is small, you don't have to read much, and you only need someone to get the notes from class that day.",

Despite prof saying that TAs marked all exams and papers very carefully, points were randomly taken off without feedback. Even though this is an 'easy' class, seems as though prof wants to make it tougher to get an A. Also, lectures were scattered. Took forever to grade.", 
            "Doesn't grade fairly in my opinion. Wrote the same stuff another friend, but got different grades. He is, however, a great lecturer and although his lectures are kind of scattered, you'll be fine as long as you memorize the key terms he gives.",

The only concrete due date seemed to be that of our final project (see: comment below this), and class discussions turned largely tangential and oddly personal.", 
            "We went the entire semester without a single assignment or grade. Granted, it was her first time teaching the class, but she was definitely winging everything. Every class was just discussion about the creative writing projects we were each working on. Tetel is, nevertheless, an engaging and thoughtful teacher.", 
            "Dr. Tetel was my favorite professor at Duke. I loved her linguistics class when I took it 25+ years! BDr. Tetel was so passionate and knowledgeable that I remember her and the class quite well.", 
            "I was not really interested in this subject at the beginning of the semester, but Dr. Tetel is so passionate about the subject that it sparked my interest. There is weekly homework and reading. It is not hard, just time consuming. The final paper determined our grade in the class, but she gave us plenty of time to work on it and was very helpful.", 
            "Great teacher with an obvious passion for her field of study. In the seminar class she allows for tangents and brings about many unique and creative examples. \"Textbook\" is dry and has yet to be fully published and weekly required homework becomes more of an annoyance than an interest. Long paper due at the end but plenty of time and help to do it.", 
            "Very interesting professor who's easy to talk to and get along with, makes the subject material entertaining and relatable. Grade depends on one midterm, one final, and one project, but overall it's not bad. I would take it again", 
            "Mostly a discussion-based class with one long final project at the end. Very nice lady, however, just make sure to participate as much as possible.",

            "I took \"Language and Evolution\". The class was VERY disorganized, but I ended up learning a bunch of information and had a blast at the same time. She loves her field and exudes enthusiasm, and our class felt more like a family than anything else. Linguistics was not a prereq, and it probably should have been--but she explained what we needed.",

            "I made an A in the class. Yet, even with a whole bunch of hard and useless homework assignments, papers, and take home tests, I learned nothing. The work is tedious, and Ling 101 should be a mandatory prerequisite. Excellent writing skills help you get through, but it's painful to do the work and make it sound coherent. Not worth it.",

Tetel does very little, and when she does lecture, she is incredibly spastic and scatter-brained. By no means is this an easy A.", 
            "I agree with a lot of what's been said here. Take 101 first. Class is a series of guest lecturers who all teach different things -- there's no continuity, I don't feel like I actually learned anything! Weekly HW assignments are frustrating, midterm and papers are painstaking. Tetel is one of the most scatterbrained people I've ever met.", 
            "Tetel is a great teacher, but this course does not utilize her teaching; it's mainly guest lectures. What makes no sense to me is why Ling 101 is not a prerequisite; most kids are scraping by without the background knowledge. The textbook work (which there is plenty of) expects a pretty solid background in the subject.", 
            "More busy work than the class is worth. 3 papers, midterm, final, and horrible weekly homework assignments. Tetel is very enthusiastic, but all the grading is done by TAs. Linguistics 101 should be a prerequisite to this class to have a solid idea of what's going on. If you just do the work, a B will come naturally.", 
            "Really interesting class and teacher! However I would recommend not taking it before you've taken 101. The class assumes you know a lot that you probably don't. TAs grade everything, including papers. Needless to say, class is NOT an easy A -- it's a lot of work, with weekly HW assignments, three papers, and a take-home midterm (killer) and final.", 
            "Class is a drag with the work, and the assignments all assume you have a solid background in linguistic concepts. Tetel is amazing, but she does not lecture most of the time. Boring paper topics, tedious homework assignments, and horrendously long mid-term. Still, if you put work into this class, you will get a solid grade.", 
            "If you're an English major looking for a CTM, this is not it. This class should def have a pre-req, but doesn't. Assumes that you understand linguistic concepts already. Weekly assignments and tests have nothing to do with the lectures, which is annoying and frustrating. Papers are graded by TAs. Tetel was not helpful with problems."

            "The other reviews are pretty accurate. Boring, unclear class. He assigns a ton of reading every week that he will barely touch upon during class. There's a writing assignment due nearly every week. His grading's pretty ambiguous. If you don't write the way he views as \"correct\" writing, expect a bad grade. Never take a class with this guy.", 
            "I absolutely hated this class. I have never, ever in my life had a class that actually made me want to cry angry tears every time I sat down. If you can help it, avoid this class at all costs. If your opinion differs from his even remotely, expect to get a bad grade. Not a linguistics class, more literature. Would never recommend - save yourself.", 
            "Easily the most boring course I have ever taken. Need is an incredibly incoherent speaker and often takes 5 minutes to phrase one train of thoughts, with plenty of 'ums' and 'ahs'. Nice guy, but would highly not recommend the course.", 
            "Professor Need is the man! You have got to take his class before you graduate. Need is on a different wavelength than most professors at Duke. I've had all of the most interesting and meaningful lectures at Duke in Need's class. If you want to learn about Taoism, Native American religion, meditation, spirituality, etc. take any of his classes!", 
            "No doubt Professor Need is a nice, well-intentioned guy. The class itself is painful. The amount of reading assigned is enormous and if you're lucky you'll touch on maybe 10% of it in class. Spends too much time talking about himself. The grading on papers is impenetrable. You'll get nothing but snarky comments and an arbitrary number at the end.", 
            "Dr. Need is a very sweet man, though sometimes quite out of touch. His lectures can be brutal if you aren't interested in the subject material. If you love literature and don't mind kookyness, take it. Don't take it if you have a low BS tolerance.", 
            "Professor Need is a remarkable person in his own right. He is misunderstood by many people by has experienced much, apparent from the way he talks. His work comes alive when you speak to him during office hours and he enjoys knowing not only about what you'd like to learn but about you as a human being. Take the time to get to know him.", 
            "I've had Prof Need for 3 courses over my Duke career. Hes a great professor, very passionate about his work and his students. Open your mind and be engaged; theres a lot you can learn from this man. Great human being.", 
            "If you're looking for a polisci or pubpol kind of attitude, this is not the class for you. Its way more abstract. But I'm planning on an ICS major, so it was a really good introduction. I liked Professor need's teaching style and I actually thought it was easier to pay attention when he threw in personal stories and asked us personal questions.", 
            "Professor Need manages to make an interesting class and subject difficult to care about or stay attentive. To his students, his lectures seem to follow a whimsical outline that never quite comes together. The multiple inane tangents he distracts himself with leave most of the class lost and/or sleeping. Guest lectures are this class's saving grace.",

            "This guy is an abomination. He will ask you the most complex questions and provide absolutely no explanation. I actually feel sorry for myself for wasting an entire semester trying to sift through his nonsense. Please for the love of god do not sympathize with this guy because he seems open and somewhat vulnerable. He really cannot execute his job.",

I found out after completing the course that the entire class was available online for free with prerecorded lectures that are more helpful than she is in person. Get cozy with the textbook , because it's your main source of hope.", 
            "canelas is a really entertaining lecturer, but with the actual material she's kinda confusing in class. also go to discussion the FR on the midterms are based off discussion problems and the MC are off sapling. dropping the lowest midterm and replacing it with the final is great but the final is super hard so try to do well on all 3 midterms", 
            "I have a hard time writing thisbecause I really do like Dr. Canalas. Shes fun and cares about her students. She just cant lecture. I learned very little from class, and unfortunately my discussion TA was often unhelpful. There was little corellation between the tests and lecture/hw. Take my adviceif you can take orgo do it. If not, take 101.", 
            "Great professor, horrible class. Honestly the flipped classroom was terrible. You're expected to know random information that the TA's and the professor do not teach and they provide no textbook for supplemental help. When Dr. Canelas did lecture, which was rare, she was very personal and funny. If you have AP chem credit, just got to organic.", 
            "The flipped structure tended to be a polarizing subject- I loved it, others hated it. I think independent students with a strong chemistry background who enjoy working out problems will really enjoy the class. Due to the class structure, Canelas only lectures once a week. When she does lecture though, it's quite enjoyable- she's really hilarious!", 
            "Although I heard she's a great orgo prof, her chem 110 class was the worst. Flipped classroom sucked. She was pretty lazy too, providing little help and letting TAs make ridiculously hard quizzes and midterms. Midterms are worth a lot, so don't mess up. 90% of your time in this class won't be learning; it will be doing stupid applications.", 
            "Her Chem110 class is technically flipped but every Monday lecture she did notes (which are always posted) and covered the material of the week. Had a quiz every week and did team based applications. Monday is optional but you must go Wednesday and Friday because you work in groups on problems. Shes a great prof and a funny, kind lady.", 
            "Great team-based course. Otherwise, it is a great course that applies previous knowledge about chemistry to a variety of scenarios. Additionally, Monday discussion lectures are always optional, but they are always helpful and entertaining. Canelas makes a point of making sure students have a good time. She tells great stories.", 
            "I have taken Canelas for both 201 and 210. She is the best chemistry teacher I have had at Duke. Chem210 was difficult for me and I had to spend many hours working problems, but Canelas was always helpful after class and during office hours. Her lectures went fast but were clear and examples work were hard.", 
            "When it comes to actually teaching, don't hold your breath. Expect to go through tons of different resources by yourself and teach yourself the material. Prepare to discuss the material for one day and have homework due the next day and a quiz the following day. Ex: we were supposed to cover four topics & had barely gone over 1 by the end of class", 
            "Professor Canelas is a phenomenal lecturer. She is very funny and explains the concepts extremely well. Sometimes she'll waste too much time making jokes, but it does keep the class engaged. Her tests are very fair and a lot of the questions come from topics she talks about specifically in class, so I would strongly recommend going to lecture.",

            "Definitely the easiest orgo professor at Duke. We played Jeopardy. Relatively little theory in lectures compared to the number of examples. Test questions were slight variants of lecture problems. TAKE HER IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR GPA! She's pretty funny too.", 
            "Was not very helpful outside of class and would redirect me to different resources rather than attempt to explain the material. A lot of the important concepts on the tests were not covered in lectures, and the class required a lot of self-studying. Also, be prepared for two required 8:30 discussions each week (which are group work).", 
            "I loved Canelas! She was pretty funny in class and she taught pretty well. Her exams aren't too difficult and they were fair. She does give partial credit so put an answer for each question. She loves it when people participate in her class and she had us do clicker questions to gauge our understanding of the material.", 
            "Organic Chemistry is a tough subject, but Dr. Canelas' instructions make the course bearable. The class was definitely difficult but not impossible. You just have to be prepared to do a lot of work.", 
            "One of Duke's best professors; goes at a very, very fast pace but is kind, hilarious, and a great teacher. If you put in the work, you'll succeed.", 
            "Prof. Canelas is a pretty straightforward lecturer and grader. Her grading procedures are fair but the tests can be difficult. It's essential to do the reading and practice problems in a timely fashion if you want to succeed on the tests and final. She's not much of a help if you reach out outside of class though.",

Some lectures are more better than others, but Professor Vidra is very knowledgeable and passionate about what she teaches. The readings are important for tests but not to understand lectures.", 
            "I enjoyed Professor Vidras class and found that she was very personable and accessible although I never went to her office hours. Not necessarily an easy A, but you can get one if you work for it. Her tests have weirdly specific questions but are not impossible by any means.", 
            "pretty easy class. make sure to participate in discussion/lecture, even though tbh i didn't and still did fine. make sure to go to class because exams are pretty specific on stuff she mentions in lecture. when in doubt, the go-to examples are: the red cockaded woodpecker, zebra mussels, galapagos tortoises, coral reefs, or north carolina hogs", 
            "Relates a lot of the material to current day topics. Didn't use the textbook very much. Final grade is 25% first midterm, 30% second midterm, 15% discussion participation, 30% final exam. All the exams are short answer and essay. Would recommend getting a person to study with and go over case studies/examples. Take good notes. Love her as a person!",

You can tell she is passionate about the environment which is helpful. The exams are difficult and specific, so lots of studying doesn't always equal passing.", 
            "Was not expecting this class to be so difficult. It is very lecture heavy and if you miss a lecture you 100% need to get notes. Be careful of small homeworks because you will lose marks if you dont turn them in and tests are very obscure and specific and more based on how closely you do the reading or listen to lectures, not based on the course.",

Reading helps to understand the lectures although you can just read the end of chapter summaries. Tests are really specific so find a study group. Don't skip the discussions.",

            "She's a really nice person and offers a lot of EC but she recently changed the course and made the tests a lot tougher. You have to go to lectures and do the work but still, the tests are hard and the questions are crazy specific. Tough TA graders can kill you so take every opportunity outside of tests to help your grade.", 
            "Tests are hard, but workload is small. Can't vouch for how helpful she is because I didn't go to office hours. Good class for developing an interest in environmental science, but can be painful if you don't like the subject at all. Difficulty of the tests depends greatly on the TAs. And god bless the EC opportunities.", 
            "Vidra is a phenomenal, passionate lecturer, and I learned a TON from this class. While tests are tough and extremely specific (attendance and attentively doing ALL readings are musts for doing well), she is extremely helpful and just an overall really kind and interesting person, so definitely drop into her office hours before tests.",

She personalizes the material to her own life and makes it relevant to yours, rarely gives busy work, and offers fun and easy extra credit opportunities. Overall a pretty chill grader. The tests are rough though so definitely get a couple of people in the class to study with.",

Yeah he's probably way to smart to be teaching this class and sometimes can be hard to follow in lecture and the daily quizzes are a little ridiculous but if you want a future in stats he is hands down the best professor you could ask for. Test & HW are hard but he curves fairly.", 
            "This class had an insane workload-quizzes every lecture and ridiculous homework assignments. The curve both made and killed my grade, since students who had time to study for quizzes on a daily basis did way better. Do not take this class with other difficult classes.",

            "CompSci 94 is supposed to be easy but Professor Rodger makes it so difficult to learn anything. She is not open to any questions or helping any students, her TA's do a better job at teaching than she des. Do not take this class if you're looking for an easy A or to learn anything useful about computer science.", 
            "Absolutely horrible professor. Was abrasive to questions, and when she did take them usually answered them rudely. Sometimes had 4 or more things due in one week with a midterm on the way. Clearly doesn't care about her students. Avoid at all costs.", 
            "Professor Rodger strikes me as someone who understands the material very well herself, but has a tough time imparting that to others. In short, a lot of the learning in her computer science classes has to be done on your own.", 
            "Rodger is really sweet and cares about her students, but isn't a great lecturer. I came in having zero CS background and was fine. The workload is extremely heavy in this class with nonstop assignments, but eventually you begin to get efficient at it. The tests, however, are extremely easy and are identical to previous years which are available", 
            "I underestimated the class... it was one of the most work intensive classes from my last semester. Be ready to work really really hard and be on top of your things even though I knew some python before coming in", 
            "Had no coding exp. but am math-sci guy. HUGE workload, but having old exams (easy to master) made class not too bad. I spent many hours with TAs, but do APTs and cool assignments, GET HELP, and you'll do fine. Lectures mostly tips, not teaching, but try attending. TAs are amazing, helpful. Most find 101 very easy or hard, depends on aptitude for CS", 
            "For a humanities major looking for a QS requirement, this was a very difficult class. The homework was never ending; once an assignment was completed after an all-nighter, another one appeared. Lectures didn't really help. It was trial by error, with a ton of error. I got a higher grade than I actually felt like I deserved, thankfully.", 
            "Dr. Rodger is a fine and boring person. Her lectures are very dull. I don't think she did a great job in teaching the class, however if you are a math and science person it will likely be an easy A. I came into the class already knowing python, and if you've had prior coding, it will be very easy.", 
            "This is a very time-intensive class (101) and there are so many reading quizzes/ assignments. Professor Rodger is very nice and aims to make the class enjoyable. However, I found that I was not able to understand concepts unless I self-studied from the online textbook. I was a bit bored sometimes, too but maybe that's because I didn't put in work.", 
            "Rodger really does try to be helpful to her students. There are a lot of resources to do well. What she often lacks is proper organization so that students can find helpful information. Lectures not necessary to attend, but are helpful. Readings necessary. Do the homework and do it well. You'll be fine.", 
            "This class was a lot of work, but python is relatively easy and I enjoyed putting in the time to complete assignments. Did not pay attention to a word Susan said, only went to class to fulfill in class participation assignments, just read the super-helpful textbook and passed. Overall pretty good class and the best option to fulfill that QS.", 
            "Great teacher!", 
            "Sweet lady, but lectures are painful. There is a lot of work in this class, and I honestly don't know how people who didn't go to office hours passed. This class is an easy A if you're a compsci person, but if you're not, it's really difficult.", 
            "Lectures are a bit dry and recap the readings. Lecture slides are posted online but attendance is mandatory. Very assignment heavy class: weekly quizzes, assignments, APTs and labs. Stay on top of workload and you'll be ok - don't procrastinate. Rodger and TAs have lots of office hours and are very willing to help. Definitely take if interested.", 
            "Prepare to be lured, swept away, and absolutely enraptured by the arms of sleep. So skip lectures since you won't stay awake anyways. Prepare to invest time on assignments (harder ones take 5+ hrs). CS101 is polarizing; people find it easy or hard without many in between, so experience it yourself.", 
            "Rodger gets a bad rep, but really isn't that bad and 101 is an easy A", 
            "Professor Rodger was tried hard to make lectures interactive, but they were boring at times. Lots of work, although not too hard and I learned a lot. Professor Rodger is also just a really nice person, she really wants her students to like Computer Science, and made us cookies and fudge sometimes!", 
            "This class is NOT easy - you can get an A, but be prepared to do tons of busy work. Go to office hours w/ TAs religiously. Lectures are pointless - no one pays attention, but there are attendance points. APTS, Assignments, RQ, etc. - tons of assignments, you'll have several hours of work per week. However, I legitimately enjoy coding which is nice.", 
            "Professor Rodger is brilliant and quirky, but her class is a pain. I've never taken computer science before so it was very difficult. She teaches Python in 101. I found to give myself 4 days to do an assignment, and 3 days to do an APT, and to do the readings as soon as possible. GO TO HELP HOURS AT NIGHT THE TAs ARE SO HELPFUL.", 
            "This class is soooooo easy. Recommend for anyone who can remotely handle a course that is not in the humanities."

            "Vigdor is amazing, but this class is based on a curve so your grade depends on how well you do relative to your peers. Memos can be hard to do above average on. This class includes entry level game theory and economics (we needed a calculator for our last course) so don't enroll thinking you're just doing policy analysis.", 
            "Vigdor is my favorite professor so far at Duke--because of her and this class, I decided to be a PubPol major. It's definitely challenging, but anyone who goes to class and puts in time and a sincere effort will do well. She is entertaining and hold students' attention. Go to office hours for extra help because she explains topics in multiple ways.", 
            "This class is hard and the grading is harsh, but the class is very interesting and is necessary if you want to do anything in this field.", 
            "She tries really hard to make her students understand the material but I think Sanford's strict B curve hinders the class. I have learned a ton but am not entirely sure how this will ever apply to my life.", 
            "Hard course but really interesting concepts. I am now considering majoring in pubpol. She explains really difficult ideas really well. I've heard she is better than the other intro teacher so take this course second semester.", 
            "Tests are really hard. this is a weed out course necessary for the major but supposedly is not an accurate representation of the other classes. memos are graded harshly. she will love if you go to her office hours and work with her. i think she is a pretty good teacher but this class shouldnt be taken \"just for fun\". know what you are getting into", 
            "She was very boring and her tests are extremely hard. A lot of the problems on the tests are designed to be completely different than the study guides.", 
            "very knowledgeable.. a little but biased to her opinion of health care so hard to get her to accept your points in your papers/in class.. a little unclear what she considers \"important\" enough for the tests/papers.. but overall, a good class and a good topic to know about! recommended!", 
            "she is knowledgeable and enthusiastic but speaks too fast so not quite clear about the really important points. the exams are hard and detail oriented. it's her first time to teach course so sometimes she was not fully prepared.", 
            "Excellent professor. She is extremely knowledgeable about public policy and teachers it with enthusiasm. Memos are graded harshly, but if you do as well as the average or better you're fine. Need to do significantly better than the average on exams to get an A. Highly recommended if you're prepared to study the material.", 
            "This class is hard but you will learn to love it with Vigdor. She is awesome as an individual and a lecturer. Work hard and you will be okay. Not a lot of reading but a lot of studying to do well. Overall this class is awesome but is not for that faint of heart. If you have to take it take it with Vigdor! Attend TA sessions as well, very helpful!", 
            "Awesome lecturer! Very interesting and clear. Take 55 with her for sure.", 
            "Great lectures!!! if you must take pps 55, you should definitely take it with Vigdor. TA sessions are helpful. things you hear about this class will scare you, but don't hesitate. a good background in econ and stat (pps majors: taking care of the econ 51/55, stat 101/102/103 requirement before taking this class will definitely help you)", 
            "Great teacher w/ very interesting lectures. Class is unfortunately curved hard, but overall it's not too bad.", 
            "Vigdor is an amazing professor. She is so helpful and approachable. 55 is hard but manageable and pertinent to the real world. Just do practice problems, ask her questions, go to lecture and you should do fine. It's a weed-out class so don't freak out about not getting an A, its normal, but with extra effort totally possible.", 
            "Absolutely wonderful! She's very intelligent, dedicated, and helpful. Her class is somewhat difficult but very relevant to the real world and very useful. Take it if you can!", 
            "Prof. Vigdor is awesome, take 55 with her if you can. Very clear lectures. The curve is difficult in this class, but there are so many practice problems made available for the tests that you should do well if you work hard.", 
            "She was excellent. Difficult class to get an A in but extremely interesting", 
            "Amazing teacher- great at explaining difficult concepts, she's never condescending and she genuinely WANTS you to understand the material. She turns a dry subject matter into an interesting class. I wouldn't reccommend this class \"for fun\" or as an easy freshman intro course (it's not), but for you PPS majors, definately try to get vigdor for 55.", 
            "55 is a very demanding class. However, Vigdor is a great professor and I highly recommend you take the class with her if that's possible. The midterms are miserable and the memos worse. However, it isn't a bad class; granted it makes you work a lot more than most other classes at Duke, but its not unbearable its just hard. The TAs can be great help"

He makes you think about what you say with your discussion comments- very valuable for real world. Received a very average (and deserved) grade, but am grateful to have taken class. You'll learn a lot from him.", 
            "Best teacher at Duke.", 
            "Arbitrary and unforgiving. I went to speak with him about an essay he graded. He gave me my points back. We then proceeded to talk about the class after he handed my test back. Five minutes into this convo, he took back my paper and docked even more points from my paper than he did initially.",

One of the best prof's at Duke, he tells it like it is, very knowledgable and intelligent guy, also has a quirky personality and good sense of humor. Class is far from easy but its well worth the experience. movies range from highly interesting, to extremely disturbing", 
            "Really interesting class. even if the lectures were long, I found them engaging. Responds well to email. Best if you go meet with him because he offers his advice. However, TAs were extremely UNHELPFUL. Gonzalez seemed to be the only one who cared. The scary part about this class was not knowing what you got until you actually got your final grade.",

            "Professor was rude and arrogant. Was not shy about shooting down comments he disagreed with. Moved our exam up 3 weeks with 1 week notice.

Was unclear about project",

He is an arrogant, rude and inconsiderate person who would show up to a 6-9pm class 15 minutes late and keep class over an hour late regularly. He tested us on tiny details from movies that we had seen once, rather than important concepts from the reading or lectures. Overall: complete misery.", 
            "Prof. Paletz is mean to students and makes fun of people when their responses are wrong. He was extremely arrogant and enjoyed his own voice far too much. He was extremely unclear as to what was to be expected of exams and the major paper in the class. Class was painful and most students hated him. Steer clear if possible.",

            "Professor Byerly is truly one of a kind. She has a wealth of knowledge from her experiences around the globe that she readily shares. I learned more about life from her than any other professor. She has a passion for teaching, public speaking and music, all of which shine through in her genial personality. I would take her class 100x over. Love her", 
            "A fantastic professor who provides a lot of great feedback and insight. She created a wonderful learning environment where students supported each other and where we learned a lot from our classmates. She's encouraging and caring - two qualities that made her public speaking class so enjoyable. Her constructive criticism has improved my confidence!", 
            "Easily one of the best professors I've had at Duke. Would strongly recommend. You get what you put into the class and most of your grade is based on the portfolio and your participation in lectures.",

On the last day of class, she handed out a letter detailing why she doesn't give many As so make sure that you really work for it. Overall incredible experience.", 
            "Professor Byerly's freshman seminar is the type of course where you get out what you put in. The workload is small, but class discussions are enjoyable if you participate. Byerly really just wants you to show some effort and try to engage with the material. Class is not very structured and sometimes a bit slow, but overall pretty chill.", 
            "This is an amazing class. Treat it as a chance to experiment. If you're new to public speaking or aren't very confident in your ability, this will come easy. If you're already a good public speaker, learn from the different styles everyone else brings to the table. Your grade is mostly based on your portfolio, so put some effort into it.", 
            "Amazing class if you're a bad public speaker, but if you're already solid you won't improve much. An A is not guaranteed", 
            "Professor Byerly is fantastic. Her public speaking class is one of the most practical classes out there, and she assigns very valuable exercises to help you improve. She gives a lot of feedback and is so sweet all the time. I would highly recommend taking any of her classes.",

This class is also good for someone who is terrified of public speaking - most of us (including myself) were to some extent. Great class.",

He's a really cool guy, very understanding and wants his students to do well. But the criteria for this class is insane and he teaches it much akin to 161. Pretty sure he uses the same textbook, given that his textbook is self-written.", 
            "RGB is a very interesting and nice guy, and I wish I knew him outside of physics class, because he is one of the worst lecturers I have ever had. Every class is full of derivations and math, which he makes confusing and un-engaging. Unless you really love math and physics, don't take his class. He does seem to care about his students, though.", 
            "The pace of this class is absurd, with four hour lecture periods. spend class deriving and proving formulas without much guidance on how to solve problems which makes hw very hard. Peer tutors completely booked out at a 1:5 ratio and then private grad student tutors booked up too", 
            "I really like the structure of the class and the absolute grading that he does. he does tend to ramble, but in general he knows what he's talking about. he wrote the textbook and the problems that he uses to teach the class, so as long as you do all the resources that he gives you, it's pretty easy. wouldn't have wanted to take 151 with anyone else", 
            "Professor Brown definitely knows what he is talking about. He sometimes has a tendency to ramble, which can make his lectures more difficult to follow, but it wasn't a big problem. This class was also a big time commitment in terms of number of hours spent in the classroom, and there was decent amount of homework.", 
            "He's one of the very best professors at Duke! Review and do problems every night, even if it's just one problem. Being able to derive things is really helpful. If you have any difficulties go talk to him. It's helpful to read the textbook before going to lecture", 
            "He is knowledgeable but does not know how to teach that knowledge. Students come out of the lectures more confused than before. Any qualitative skills I've gained from the course are from studying outside the class with the help of my friends. He has personally contributed 0 to my understanding of physics. Textbook and hours of struggling did that", 
            "Cannot explain physics. Just cant. Knows his stuff but prone to tangents and arrogance. Doesn't even hold office hours. If u don't know tons of calculus and very God at math and physics to begin with, rest in peace if u take his class", 
            "If you aren't polished with your 141 and calc math and just the perfect physics student, prepare to struggle. the hardest class i have taken (this is after all of my other premed courses). throws unexplained concepts at you and expects you to \"obviously\" understand everything without any basics.", 
            "Great guy, hard but if you put in the work, totally doable", 
            "One of the best professors I've had at Duke. The course was very difficult for me, but Dr. Brown did everything in his power to make sure his students succeeded. I utilized every single out of class resource and managed to pull a good grade but really put in a lot of work. Great guy to talk with, clear lecturer, very fair grader.", 
            "Was pretty difficult, but helped me so much outside of class that I saved my grade. Also the nicest guy, gives out chocolate, likes to talk to students about other stuff besides physics, made me really enthusiastic to continue taking his class.", 
            "Dr. Brown (at least for this class) talked way over my head most of the time and I felt lost 9 times out of 10. As a non-physics major, I felt out of place and Dr. Brown didn't do much to remedy that. He didn't hold office hours with any sort of regularity and it felt like the students were left to fend for themselves.", 
            "Professor Brown is a very helpful professor who really is there for his students. He is more than willing to help (as his class, problems, and tests are very difficult) - for instance, he even stays past the 9pm end of office hours sometimes until 11pm or midnight until the last student's questions are answered. He is so nice as well as brilliant.", 
            "Dr. Brown is very enthusiastic and always available to help. he tries hard to make sure that the material is understandable and fair, and offers a lot of opportunities to practice outside of class. That being said, the material is very hard if you haven't already taken physics, so you have to keep up with the work consistently to do well.", 
            "Great professor who is willing to help. If you just keep up with the assigned work, you'll be fine.", 
            "He has his own textbook and his lectures are almost word-for-word the same thing he says in his textbook. Do not be afraid to ask questions - he can be intimidating, but he is actually a nice guy. Overall, the class is not terrible but it is not the easiest class either. Just make sure you keep up with the work.", 
            "Had him at the Marine Lab, and he was fantastic. He invests a lot of time in making sure you're understanding what he teaches. The textbook really isn't necessary if you have good lecture notes, since he wrote his book. He's also pretty repetitive in the problems he likes giving out. I recommend having him at the Marine Lab rather than at Duke.", 
            "Brown is a great recitation professor; I wish I'd had him for lecture as well. He is charismatic and clear in his explanation of the material and the homework problems. I can't speak to his tests though because he didn't write our recitation quizzes.", 
            "Took both 53 and 54 w/Brown at Marine Lab. This man exudes compassion. Do the online practice problems for quiz/test prep and you will do well. He wants you to succeed and will go the extra mile to help. After ten weeks with the guy, I have nothing but respect. He's a boss. AND he gives you candy."

            "Although Professor Glander is very old-school, he's still a great lecturer. He may be a bit dry at times but the course material is quite interesting. The only annoying thing is the massive memorisation process that everyone undertakes before each midterm.", 
            "Very memorization-based, with much of the info being from hs bio or intuitive. Not a difficult class, but go to lecture; his ppts aren't stellar on their own, and his recording doesn't always work. Get into the discussion section if you can! It'll replace a bad test grade. Tests are straight-forward, basically just regurgitation", 
            "Excellent professor! Very knowledgeable on the subject and would recommend as a nice easy class to take.", 
            "Arguably one of the easiest classes at Duke. Glander can be boring, but some of the material can be very interesting. Many of the concepts are learned in high school biology classes. Attendance is optional, but definitely go because he will say things that arent on his powerpoints that appear on his tests.", 
            "One of the nicest and most interesting professors at Duke.", 
            "EvAnth 101 with Prof. Glander was a great experience! He has over 40 years of field experience, and so his lectures not only are very interesting but he is the most knowledgable teacher I've ever had about a particular subject. Yes, he shows old videos, but they relate to what we learn in class so they're interesting nonetheless.", 
            "He has been teaching this class for 38 years. Considering the only thing he does in class is read from his slideshow and show monkeys washing potatoes, you would expect the quality of the presentations to be really good. They're not. He had info from the 70s in one of his presentations. Wouldn't recommend taking this class.", 
            "This guy is very cool. He is an expert in the field and has done a lot of cool things! He is also kinda fun, makes jokes every class but no one laughs. Definitely recommend this class. Makes me wish I would have taken more evanth classes!", 
            "The class isn't hard, but Glander can make the lecture a bit dry. I loved the material however. He's a nice guy and covers all the important info, it's just not thrilling - definitely just an introductory, lecture-style class. Lectures aren't mandatory and are posted online, but discussion is required but can replace a bad midterm grade (take it!)", 
            "I really recommend taking the discussion. It replaced one of my grades in the class, and it gives context for what you're learning. It's not hard but it does take significant memorization. You don't need to go to class but it makes studying easier. If you don't open the book you will do fine but there are always a few questions from it on his exams", 
            "Take the discussion section if you are worrying about your grade in the class. It replaces lowest grade on midterm (30%). Also course seems like useless memorization without discussion. If you actually spend time studying for the tes (powerpoints + brief textbook) you should get an A no problem. Class Attendance is completely optional.", 
            "He's insanely boring, but the material isn't that hard. Take the discussion because you can drop one of your 2 midterm grades for your discussion grade if it's higher than either of those. Lectures are posted online so you don't even need to go. He's boring..", 
            "He isn't the most interesting professor, but he does a good job for a huge lecture. He always tries to keep students interested though. There are a lot of movies. You don't really need to read the book but some questions from the test are taken from it. Very interesting introductory class.", 
            "His lectures are pretty boring, but fortunately he posts them online so if you zone out you can review them before a test. A couple days of reviewing the powerpoints and skimming the book prior to the test got me an A in the class even without taking the discussion. I would recommend it ONLY if you want to take more classes in the department.", 
            "Very easily class, so long as you pay attention to the lecture/read the slides. Reading the text is probably a good idea if you're shooting for a good grade, however, as Glander's fond of throwing in random questions on things never mentioned in his lectures that are in the book.", 
            "No a very hard class if you read and pay attention in class. Reading a lot more helpful for second test than the first one.", 
            "Very interesting lectures. Really go over powerpoints prior to the test and at least try to skim through the book.", 
            "This class was a waste of time. He just showed videos and gave basic lectures, then tested on ridiculous details from the textbook. Also he didn't seem to have best personality in class, although I never talked to him personally.", 
            "If you are looking for an easy NS course, pick a different BAA class because there are classes that are still easy but much more interesting. I am a BAA major and I hated this class because the material was easy/basic/boring, and Glander is not a very interesting lecturer. He also repeats himself a lot.", 
            "This is not an easy A. If you take it, take the discussion section. It is really the difference between failing and passing as your lowest score gets replaced. Also, he's not really the nicest guy in the world. He tends to talk down to people and make them feel stupid in front of the entire lecture section."

There are a lot of good \"professors\" at Duke but very few can offer his wisdom.",

He will challenge you to think about Yourself and how you relate to people in work and in life. Great class.",

Although his class isn't easy and he expects you to do your work, he tries to keep it as interesting as possible and you get to learn a lot. I would definitely recommend taking one of his classes.",

George provided a glimpse of the corporate world that got me excited about a career in business. My only complaint is that the class was athlete-heavy. If you can't take his class, meet him!",

All 3 assignments in this one are linked to marketing in a true business setting. If you participate in class and give assignments a good effort, you will get an A. Get to know him as well. GREAT resource to have",

He will supplement the main points from readings with his 27-year experience as a former P&G marketing exec. so what you learn from him is what you need in the real world.", 
            "Grody is a great guy. Assigned interesting and relevant readings that could be used in every day life. Lectures were never boring. He left assignments pretty open to interpretation, which was scary at first, but when you learn to use it as a chance to show some creativity, it really pays off. take his class!", 
            "George assigned interesting readings and we spent most classes discussing them as a class. We were encouraged to think about what the lessons meant to us and how we had seen them applied / think they might work. He left assignments open to interpretation. This allowed creativity, which was rewarded. This was one of the most useful classes I've had.",

            "George Grody is an amazing guy. He definitely knows his subject and does a great job teaching, but he's also incredibly approachable and \"real\" with his students. I highly recommend the new capstone class he teaches where students are in charge of a virtual company. You will learn a lot about all aspects of managing a firm.",

The best part of the class is that homework is weighted so heavily (55% our semester) that it can boost your grade a ton if you do well on them. That was generous on Lee's part.",

You learn a lot through the homeworks, which are challenging, worth a lot, and time-consuming. Exams were straightforward and Lee tells you what'll be on the test, but you don't get practice exams.", 
            "If you have to take CS/ECE 250, Lee is fine. Somehow, even his lectures about interesting material were quite boring, but I still learned a lot by studying the material and watching Sorin's lectures online.

He isn't the most \"fun\" professor but he is very good at organizing/lecturing the material in a way that makes it understandable.

Because he uses another professor's slides, he seems to read off of them without explaining them in a way that students can easily understand. I had to teach myself a lot.",

Horrible as an administrator of the class; TAs were uninformed, making it hard for us to learn. It was rare to feel prepared for HW. Cares about students, but doesn't seem to understand them.", 
            "Decent lecturer, but sometimes it would be hard to grasp the concepts on the assignments despite attending every lecture. He is quite caring and is happy to explain questions and concepts further. The class and syllabus was very straightforward, as were the tests.",

He also asked for feedback from the students about the course and made changes. He was fair on the types of questions he asked for tests and I learned a lot. Loved taking 250 with him.",

Some lectures pretty good, others really hard to understand if the material was completely new to you--the textbook's good, so I'd skim it before the relevant lectures. Homework was time consuming but helpful, but tests on the easy side (avg grades in mid 80s).",

The assignments help to reinforce the lectures, but are time consuming so start early! You learn a lot! His tests are not too difficult, but make sure you understand what is happening conceptually because there are concept questions.",

Lectures can be a bit dry, but definitely go to lab as they're open office hours for help on lab reports that are a significant chunk of your grade. You'll get out of the class whatever you put in.", 
            "Great professor who obviously cares about the students. I will reiterate the previous comments, that the books for the class are online, so you don't need to buy them. If you're coming in with previous programming experience, especially in Python this should be a pretty easy class. Just memorize the API and you're set.", 
            "EGR103 is a pretty easy class; if you want an A you'll get it. It's not a popular opinion, but I didn't like Dr. G at all. His lectures were incredibly dry, his jokes are canned and clearly rehearsed, and he just isn't a super genuine guy. The textbook is available online so don't buy it. The labs are time consuming but straight forward.", 
            "He really puts in a lot of effort into making the course extremely engaging. The class made me more interested in engineering than I already was. The tests are annoying because we have to essentially memorize API's, but other than that, the class is AWESOME!!!", 
            "Dr. G is the best prof I've had so far- he's a very fair grader and is super approachable. Textbook is online so dont buy it.", 
            "Dr. G does a very good job with this class. While sometimes the labs can take hours upon hours to complete, they are satisfying and applicable. They can touch on challenging math concepts, but Dr. G tries to explain all of them. Just make sure to study for the two midterms because they are 30% of your grade each.", 
            "Professor Gustafson is a great guy who genuinely cares about his students. If you have little programming experience he definitely tries to explain the basic concepts thoroughly and takes time each week to explain how to go about solving every problem on the lab/homework. The two midterms are definitely focused more on how well you know the syntax.", 
            "Dr. G is a great professor. He's very passionate and KNOWS what he's talking about. Unfortunately, this means that you're also expected to learn a lot of things that may or may not be tested. You come out of the class knowing the material very well but this may impact your GPA in doing so (HW is hard af). Try to take someone else for this class.", 
            "He is a good teacher, but the reality of the situation is that the vast majority of people giving this guy a 5 and rating the class with a 1-3 difficulty have prior coding experience. If you have good knowledge of coding (even in other areas) its easy. If you have no prior experience, it will take years to do the work. It's extremely difficult.", 
            "Dr. G is a funny guy with a great personality. His lectures are fast paced and sometimes not very helpful unless you actually reviewed the material beforehand. I didn't go to much of his lectures, but I could get by studying his homework (and reading the textbook). A lot of hwk! He has clear expectations on exams and is manageable", 
            "Very hard class with tons of homework, but Dr. G is there to help you out with it if you go to his lectures and office hours. He's also just a really nice guy.", 
            "I had Gustafson for EGR103, hated Matlab but loved the professor. Although he teaches a lot of other egr courses, he makes himself extremely available to students. I still wonder how he could fit so much into his schedule. He's a funny professor, pretty nerdy, but in a good way.", 
            "Dr. G is a good guy but his lectures aren't useful (usually never), I just study for exams doing the homework/reading the textbook. He's smart and quirky but if you want to really learn to do well in the class grade wise, you should try to study on your own. His office hours do help, however", 
            "Dr. G is the man. The course material was dry by nature but was a good lecturer considering that. Most of the learning comes through labs which are quite time-consuming but easy to get help with from TAs or Piazza. Getting a good grade is doable if you do the work. Overall extremely organized and dedicated to teaching.", 
            "People find him witty and like his humor - I get that. His lectures however, are incredibly fast paced and leave students lost towards the end. Walking out of lecture, most complain about how none of it made any sense. Homeworks are ridiculously time consuming, and will leave you frustrated.", 
            "Dr. G was easily accessible through Piazza. I had no prior coding before but it was still easy to end up with an A. The labs are difficult and time-consuming but just go to office hours and TAs will help you get a high grade. There were 3 major tests very similar to old tests and no final.", 
            "I greatly enjoyed my time as one of Dr. G's students. He goes out of his way to be accessible on Piazza and to make grading criteria as clear as possible. He also provides a ton of resources to help you through labs. While lectures weren't really necessary to attend, I found that the background info he provided was generally helpful in some way."

He loves to introduce different songs and movies for us in class and share his stories with us. His records his lecture every time, and his midterm and final are the same as the past ones, which makes it much easier for us to prepare for.",

But, the exams come straight from the coursepack!!! You do not need to go to class or pay attention to do good in this class; honestly his lectures just confused me.",

            "In general, he is a nice funny guy, but he can say some pretty sexist stuff. Lecture is important (trust me I didn't go because it's at 8 am and I paid for it).

All I've learnt at the end of this class is that people who babble on about IR in twisted, illogical ways are rewarded the most.", 
            "Intro to IR was an immersive, challenging and stimulating course. Material was heavy on the reading - flipped classroom - but Feaver rocks. Not an easy A, not an easy B either... a real college level course. One of the best Duke Political Science has to offer.", 
            "If you can take a class with Professor Feaver, do it. Yes, his class his hard and you absolutely have to do the readings, but you come away actually understanding the material. He makes an effort to get to know the students as well, having lunches before class and throwing a party at the end of the semester. Highly recommend.", 
            "One of the best teachers at Duke. Lots of real world and academic experience. Knows IR like no one else. Offers great advice and connections if you ask. Engaging lectures. Did a flipped class well. Very, very hard to get an A. Hard tests, must do readings and watch videos. Immensely worth taking any of his classes--you'll learn a ton.", 
            "Very Hard. Interesting class", 
            "Has a repetoire of stories that he cycles through. Do not worry about the grade... Real measure of performance in his class: do you become a main character in one of the anecdotes he will share classes to come for the next decade?", 
            "1st day of class referenced his ratemyprof comments. Very bright, provides excellent insight due to his NSC experience, and sets fair (but very tough) standards for grading. Expect to work hard and receive an A-. Great lectures, TAs can be a crapshoot, overall very good class. Learned a ton about American Foreign Policy", 
            "Has minions (aka TAs) that set up the classroom for him so that he can walk in with a satchel just as class starts, turn on the overhead, and lecture. Says vis-a-vis a lot and makes this little hand-chopping motion as if he is dividing something into sections ALL THE TIME. Just watch for it. On topic, great lectures. Take lots of notes.", 
            "TOUGH CLASS. This is the second I've had with Feaver. Very knowledgeable but expects you to spend every waking moment reading for his class. AT LEAST 200-300 pages of reading a week. Final is cumulative. Papers are graded harshly. Tough class but you learn a lot.", 
            "Comes off as very pompous and a general show off. I had to work extremely hard to make a B in the class, pacing of readings (essays, NYT) is integral.", 
            "Intro to IR with Feaver was definitely one of my favorite classes at Duke. A lot of work and you have to work for your grade, but you will learn a TON. Feaver is incredibly knowledgeable and lectures are definitely worth going to."

            "Very good prof. His lectures are very straightforward, but you need to read the book and handouts before class. The midterm and exam were based very much off the homeworks.", 
            "Hard to understand and does not welcome questions, lectures and homeworks did not correlate. Unfriendly and rude to students. Syllabus was not ever emailed, but given in hard-copy. Read though the entire thing, he has bizarre consequences and grading policies.",

However, he's a very \"intense\" professor, and he makes a lot of people uncomfortable. If you ask a dumb question, you will sorely regret it. You will learn a ton from this guy if you pay attention, though.", 
            "Incredibly demanding class. Dr. Curtaralo expectations are the highest I`ve seen at Duke. Exams are fair/difficult but long and not impossible. I got a very good grade and learned a ton of info. The material is very tough and sometimes cryptic. Overall an excellent teacher. Take it, it is worth.",

And I agree that she is egotistical and somewhat cold.",

Tests are specific, you must know \"her\" answer, so memorize the Webnotes. Discussion is a joke. The quizzes don't test knowledge but ability to memorize articles. TAs contradict Williams. Not an easy A.", 
            "Avoid taking her class if you can. She's condescending when students ask genuine questions, and her test format is confusing. There's quizzes every week on LONG articles that are barely relevant to the class. If you do take the class, study her webnotes and try to guess what she'll pull from discussion and guest lecture.", 
            "Shes rude and condescending. Lecture moves so quickly with a lot of material and youre expected to know it all. Textbook reading super helpful if you can stay on top of it. Makes you feel bad when you ask questions sometimes, but also takes twenty minutes to answer one question, meaning you often are left on your own to learn things for the exam", 
            "Williams knows the subject matter well and is pretty nice and funny, but tests were very difficult and there were quizzes every class on the long readings which were hard as well. The group paper was the only easy part of the class. I heard other Neuro 101 professors were easier so if you can, take it with them.",

I took this class as a senior and she teaches you incorrect information, is highly unclear, her testing format is absurd and the notes she gives you are impossible to follow. Grading is nit-picky and test questions often come from no where (not the study guide, book, lecture). Avoid taking with her", 
            "Test grading criteria is the most unclear I've ever experienced at Duke. Cares more about you knowing \"her\" correct answer, rather than you thinking critically (she will rarely even give you the correct answer, expects you to read her mind). Sometimes laughs at students' questions when they're genuinely confused. Not a great learning environment.",

            "Only take this class if you are considering a neuro major - it's not terrible and I learned a lot but beware that there are multiple writing assignments due and a final paper that is graded harshly by TAs. So you really have to do well on the tests, which aren't too bad. There is a ton of material though, so don't wait til the last minute to study.",

She really showed me how intriguing neuroscience can be and made me realise that I want to major in it. She is also patient and is really down to Flunch and talk about anything. Highly recommended!!!!!!!!",

Constantly belitting those who perform poorly, Williams could use a shot of dopamine to cure that scowl she has on display for those who struggle.

Seems totally insane at first but is actually a genius...and really helpful and nice. Even takes his class to his house to eat with his family. TAKE HIM BEFORE YOU LEAVE DUKE!",

Keep up with the reading, be willing to speak- you will be rewarded. Make an effort to go to office hours, it's like a bonus seminar. Oh, and maybe watch a couple of episodes of Rome and The Sopranos- you'll see.",

Do the reading, really engage yourself with the material, and work harder than you ever thought you could on the essays, and this will be your favorite class--not to mention your favorite prof--at Duke.",

Ferraro is a genius, there is no denying that, but he was definitely not a freshman professor and his knowledge and expectations were intimidating. Great, warm man nonetheless, but a genius that demands genius. Given that was his first freshman class, he will bea better frosh prof.",

            "Pfau was funny, smart, and caring, but the course content was unbearably boring, and his lectures were dry and long. Despite it being a seminar, nobody talked much besides him. He's a fine prof, but don't expect him to magically make you engaged in a boring class.", 
            "Although this was a class designed for freshmen, Pfau blew me away. 89S (The Enlightenment) involved a lot of complex readings, but Pfau could answer an infinite number of questions regarding them or any other topic. Come to class with a question or input. His responses astound he's always the smartest guy in the room. Easy grader for us though", 
            "I think that he's very smart and has knowledge almost about everything. He's really funny and nice. I always enjoy it when he talks and explains things and I love love love when he talks about his wife. I actually want to meet her. I would definitely take his class again if I could. In fact I'm searching for other classes he may be teaching.", 
            "Professor Pfau is unbelievably intelligent and articulate. He uncovers layers of depth and meaning in the material and in life that are inscrutable to the untrained mind. The experience of studying with him is transformative & should be requisite before graduating. Also, in resp. to below, this class covered exactly what the syllabus said it would.", 
            "Pfau is brilliant and witty, but also dry and monotonous. Combine that with the fact that his class's subject was very misleading (we studied theological foundations of higher education instead of the advertised \"University and Why It Matters\") and I regret taking his class. He's a nice person and wants you to do well, but I barely paid attention", 
            "I don't even know where to begin with Professor Pfau. He is one of the most understated geniuses I've ever met. You know when you meet someone for the first time and they just exude knowledge? That's the sensation you get when Professor Pfau walks into the room on the first day of class. He is 100% willing to meet with you outside of classjust ask", 
            "Dr. Pfau has to be one of the best minds and profs at Duke. In class, his comments are thought-provoking, witty, and intellectually stimulating. One can almost feel his/her worldview being sculpted as the analyses the works at hand with a comprehensive interdisciplinary approach. He is a true scholar, not to mention a fair, punctual grader.", 
            "Thomas Pfau is an outstanding professor. The course he taught was fascinating and eye opening and left me thinking way after the course concluded. He has an almost encyclopedic knowledge of his subject which he is more than willing to share. I would highly recommend him to anyone seriously interested in learning.", 
            "Prof Pfau has a superb command over the English language, and an incredible knowledge in, it seems, almost every literary field. He is able to convey ideas in a most accurate, engaging and ingenious way. Overall, he is insightful, witty and humorous. Personally I wish the topics in the class more focused and the direction of the discussion clearer.", 
            "Overall, Professor Pfau did an excellent job keeping the class engaged in conversation pertaining to issues today and through the reading of several texts. I hoped there would be more assignments, but there were only two major papers. There could have been better clarification about the expectation of papers, but overall a good class.", 
            "Prof Pfau is a fascinating and witty speaker. He seems to have near perfect recall of a wide range of literature, philosphy and history. He weaves these disciplines together for a compelling class discussion. One must be willing to jump into the conversation rather than wait for the open ended question to signal class participation.", 
            "Professor Pfau is arguably the most intelligent and passionate professor on campus. He teaches by lecture using sharp. clear language and comical witticisms, but is also very encouraging of students asking questions as to better understand the material. He always outlines what he expects of his class. His life advice, though, is the best of all.", 
            "Despite being a FOCUS seminar, course time was primarily filled with Professor Pfau's lectures. Almost zero discussion. Course was otherwise not difficult-- grades based primarily off papers, which the TA grades the majority of.", 
            "I really liked Pfau in my Readings in Genre class on Lyric Poets. His classes are very discussion based, so that is great if you like to offer your interpretation of a work. The only grades came from several essays, which graded somewhat hard, but mostly pretty fair. Also, HIS GERMAN ACCENT IS AWESOME.", 
            "Great prof--absolutely brilliant. Grading is hard, but fair, and an A is within the realm of possibility. One of the best classes I've taken at Duke. Pfau cares about his students and genuinely wants you to succeed.", 
            "Brilliant professor. I ranked his easiness as 2, but that's only because his assignments require a lot of insight and critical thinking. It's not impossible to do well--An A is definitely attainable. Take a class with this guy and you'll see why he has such rave reviews. Rarely did I leave his class without being blown away", 
            "Great teacher. Smartest guy I've ever met in my life. He's not an easy grader and it's a ton of work, but honestly worth every moment of it.", 
            "Lots and lots of reading. His lectures are interesting for the most part but he can get into some really esoteric things that don't help you with assignments. Only take a class with him if you're already interested in the topic. Also, the TA for this course did all of the grading so expectations aren't entirely clear.", 
            "By far my favorite teacher this semester. Absoulutly brilliant, he can directly quote philosophers from the top of his head, page number and all. But his lectures are fascinating, I was intimidated at first, but Pfau if a funny, interesting, and hilarious teacher. Take every class you can with him.", 
            "Probably the best professor I've had at Duke. Pfau is a fascinating lecturer, with a seemingly endless stock of fascinating tidbits pertinent to the subject matter. In addition to providing (and fostering) insightful analysis of a given text, he brought the big picture of the rise of the novel to life. Take a class with Pfau if you possibly can."

Your grade depends on only a few things (the final paper making 40% of it), but Newcity is always accessible and is a lenient grader. I learned so many new things from this class. 10/10 would recommend", 
            "Great prof & fairly easy class.", 
            "Newcity is funny, approachable, and an easy grader. This class was for the FOCUS program. It is a great way to ease into Freshman year with a low workload. He is NOT there to kill you, he just challenges you and makes you think. If anything, this class taught me how to think on the spot when someone (invariably) challenged my opinion.", 
            "There is very little homework or work, you just show up to class and talk about your individual opinions on certain issues. The readings that he assigns are not necessary but interesting and do help you contribute more to the conversation. You do not learn much in this class. Newcity is a very nice professor, and is caring and easygoing.", 
            "I took Newcity's class Law, Ethics, and Responsibility for focus. The class was discussion based, with about a third of the course centered around thought experiments like what level of moral responsibility do Zombies have. He's an engaging and caring professor who doesn't take himself (or his student's lol) too seriously.", 
            "Michael is a great professor. I really recommend taking his class in the Focus program, as he is an easy grader and a great professor to start with freshman year. He is relatable and approachable. The classes are discussion based and the readings are interesting.", 
            "I'm always skeptical reading \"This was my favorite professor at Duke\" but that being said this is the one professor through almost 3 years I'm certain is my favorite. Amazingly engaging lectures, super personality, wants to get to know his students. Attend classes and actively participate and you will learn so much while getting a good grade.", 
            "Professor Newcity is the boss. Honestly these reviews don't do him justice. He's such an organized, funny, and engaging lecturer. I usually don't speak in class, but in a class of 40 students, I surprisingly felt comfortable answering questions. Grading was pretty lenient, but that's TA dependent. Show up to class and you'll be good.", 
            "Newcity's Law, Ethics, and Responsibility class was a lot of fun. Minimal homework, but our class discussions and papers were always very thought-provoking. Would definitely recommend his class to neuro and law FOCUS students.", 
            "Professor Newcity is a true jewel of Duke University. He is incredibly knowledgeable about many aspects of Law and First Amendment rights, Russian history, and most importantly, is an incredibly nice and caring instructor.", 
            "Took Professor Newcity and his Eastern Europe class. Absolutely fantastic guy. Would strongly recommend him to future students.", 
            "Loved taking Prof. Newcity's class on Eastern Europe. Highly knowledgeable on Eastern European and Russian affairs with a sharp wit at the same time. I would definitely recommend him to future students.", 
            "Michael is one of my favorite teachers I have ever had. The guy is absolutely hilarious and his homework is incredibly easy. Only major assignments were 3 essays and a research paper. Sadly though, I didn't put as much effort as I should have and got an A- instead of A, which means I got a 3.7 in my easiest class.", 
            "A funny and chill professor. Always very objective and genuinely open to all opinions. The whole course is hugely discussion-driven - didn't feel like I learned much legal and neuroscientific knowledge as expected, but it was still quite intellectually stimulating. You don't actually need to read the readings. 3 essays & 1 final paper. Easy A.", 
            "Professor Newcity is a little scatterbrained and unclear about assignments, but he is an intelligent and funny professor. Most of class was spent discussing random tangential topics. Easy to get a good grade, mostly papers.", 
            "I took this class for FOCUS. It was very interesting. You don't necessarily need to do the readings. Professor Newcity is funny and accessible via email. This is probably the easiest class in the CogNeuroSciAndLaw FOCUS cluster. Nothing negative to say about Professor Newcity. He's a chill guy whose class can be boring at times, but is pretty easy.", 
            "Newcity is awesome. This class on obscenity and free speech has hilarious and insightful. If you want to hear your professor swear A LOT, take this class. Very informative on free speech difference between US and other nations. Assigned papers are open-ended and graded fairly leniently. Readings are interesting. Take this professor!", 
            "Class is easy. Readings are rarely used in class, so out of class time is rare. Three major papers are writing throughout the semester for 75% of the grade and participation makes up the remaining 25%. Class is interesting and Newcity is extremely knowledgable, although the class does tend to be repetitious. Overall - solid class.", 
            "Professor is useless. According to his syllabus, he teaches 15 classes; student presentations make up the remaining 12, excluding exams. His midterm questions are incommensurate with the level of instruction; he predominantly picks esoteric facts. Missed attendance is penalized harshly, despite the fact that it's a HUGE, BORING lecture. Sucks.", 
            "Power of Language Focus: Language and the Law. It was a fun, low-stress class with interesting discussions. He is a reasonable guy with a lot of interest in what he's teaching. If you're looking to improve your writing, though, look elsewhere. Essay comments are not helpful."

BUT, in the last 2 weeks, we were assigned an 11-18 page paper PLUS a 2-page reaction paper for EACH of the 17 papers submitted in class. Do the math. Plus, the listening exam was insane.", 
            "The seminar consisted of listening to Davidson lecture for 75 minutes. Although he is passionate about the topic, it became rather boring for me. There was also still considerable work: preparing a group presentation, writing a research paper, peer evaluations, and a listening test. I would have picked a more interesting seminar if there were spots", 
            "There is very little work up until the last few weeks of class. The 12-18 page term paper is 40% of the grade and a listening test is 20%. If you spend enough time and effort on both of those, you should get an A. Listening test is difficult if you're not very musical.", 
            "Professor Davidson is a great teacher who is very enthusiastic about his subject. There is a 12-18 page paper and a listening test. If you are accustomed to the music, the listening test is easy. However, if you have no musical experience, the taking the class still is a good idea. It will just take a little more work.", 
            "If you are a musician, a huge leg up, but more expectation for participation. One thing my classmates struggled the most was the one and only matching quiz for composer, era, type of music, and related Shakespearean play. If your iTunes is 80% classical, and if you can make educated guesses on those info. just by listening, it's a piece of cake.", 
            "Easy, enjoyable. Relaxing mid-afternoon class with an almost guaranteed A as long as you can write decently and identify music pieces. VERY FRIENDLY PROFESSOR", 
            "Overall Music in Shakespeare was a really cool class. it wasn't too hard and I really think that I learned a lot about music.

If you don't have an interest in classical music, it will be boring. If you have an interest, it may be the best course you've ever taken. You'll get an A if you put in reasonable effort and don't sleep.",

Professor Davidson loves the subject and if you participate and show some enthusiasm he'll really appreciate it. 3 assignments can get a bit overwhelming (18 pg paper), but its really not bad bc he is an easy grader. Just participate a lot and he'll help you out in the end.", 
            "Very nice guy, no matter what he'll always give you positive feed back. There's not much work and he's super enthusiastic. As for grading, he's really nice and if you participate a lot, he'll most likely give you an A despite your other grades.", 
            "I had high expectations of the class before I took it, but it was really disappointing. I basically learned nothing at all, and the class was extremely dull the majority of the time. Prof. Davidson is a very nice man, but the class was not very stimulating.", 
            "Prof Davidson is great!! He's a really smart guy and his freshman seminar is the EASIEST seminar offered! You listen to music in class, read almost nothing outside of class and only have 3 assignments the whole year: a ppt,12-18pg paper on a composer & an easy listening exam. He can sometimes mumble and get boring but he's a really nice guy & easy",

She is very nice and she puts all her effort into making class a fascinating an educational time. As long as you participate and do all the readings, her class is fairly straightforward. After this semester, my French is a lot better.", 
            "Deb is fabulous! She is extraordinarily helpful and love French and loves teaching French. We don't have a textbook, so read the readings and take good notes on them, because that's what the tests are based on. She's extremely fair in her grading and always willing to meet with you about anything!", 
            "A very organized and fair teacher. She is reasonable and interesting and I highly recommend taking French with her.",

She is a fair grader and is really out there to help you. You would be a fool not to take a class with her. Makes a fifty minute class seem like thirty.", 
            "She's an amazing professor. Definitely one of my favorites at Duke! She has all it takes and more to be a great professor-- intelligent, great personality, clarity, passion.", 
            "Helpful, interesting, and reasonable. Deb was able to make a dull subject (advanced grammar/writing workshop, really?) interesting and even the grammar review wasn't bad. I wish more professors at Duke were like her. Take her class, you won't regret it.", 
            "She's amazing! This was my first class at Duke, and she was such a good teacher! I know that she probably liked out class more than others, but she's very fair and incredibly helpful. Can be tough if she doesn't like you, but it isn't hard to get on her good side.", 
            "Deb Reisinger is an outstanding french professor and probably one of the nicest people you will meet on the Duke faculty. She speaks crystal clear, the requirements for assignments are well stated, and she is not a terribly difficult grader, which can be a problem in language courses. I don't love French, but I would take another course with her.", 
            "She's a great french teacher. I came into the class planning on fulfilling the requirement, and now I'm seriously considering minoring in french. Not too much work, and the class discussions are usually very interesting!", 
            "Reisinger is simply an incredible teacher. There's a decent amount of work in the class but it's not difficult. She's a really fair grader and is extremely helpful if you have any questions - she wants you to do well in the class, which is important. This class made me want to continue with French.", 
            "Definitely not an easy grader but she's fair and communicates what is expected. Excellent lecturer, dynamic personality, and very enthusiastic about helping students so long as they are trying as well - one of the best in the French program.", 
            "Who wouldn't love Deb?? She's really sweet. Not the easiest prof but not too hard either."

If you didn't do well you either didn't read before a quiz or blatantly didn't follow rules or show up to service learning. Very heavily discussion based class which I loved because you can sit bit and listen or jump in and engage as much as you want. Dr. Gold is a gem.", 
            "Not much of a class. You just sit there and listen to Dr. Gold repeat stories about aging, and share your own experiences with the service-learning component of the course. Her grading criteria is super strict, and she doesnt provide you a rubric. Made a mistake taking this class..", 
            "Dr. Gold isn't the best professor in the sociology department. Her lectures are somewhat scattered, and most of class time is spent discussing about your time volunteering with the service learning portion of the class. Her assignment criteria is super strict, and she doesn't do a great job of explaining exactly what she wants. Would not take again", 
            "I've had a number of pretty bad sociology professors at Duke, but Dr. Gold definitely would top the list. Her lectures are just her re-hashing some past experiences that she repeats over and over again. She's also unnecessarily nit-picky when grading.", 
            "Dr. Gold is an amazing professor. She is caring and dedicated, and an overall joy to be in a class with. She can seem strict, but if you follow her guidelines for papers (which she is very explicit with) you will be fine. Highly recommend, especially for anyone going into a medical field.", 
            "Funny and sweet. She's sassy and is very outspoken and liberal. Sometimes she says really weird stuff, but everyone loves her. Quizzes easy. Just show up and say stuff in class sometimes. She's great, and loves talking with the class. you basically just share your opinions/experiences on death and healthcare. didn't learn much though. fun class",

            "Dr. Gold is an experienced educator and has a lot to tell. Her Medical Sociology class, while insightful, focused heavily on the elderly and end-of-life care (her specialty). If you are interested in this, I recommend taking this class. Service learning is incorporated heavily into class discussion. Follow her guidelines for papers carefully.", 
            "Death&Dying was so interesting, and Dr. Gold is so inspiring. There were weekly readings and two reading quizzes that were super easy. There is one big final paper. She wants it to be done in a very specific way. If you follow her guidelines, you will be fine. It is a service learning course, only 2 hours of volunteering per week. Take this course!", 
            "Last rating's a bit rough- she's a great speaker esp for newcomers to the subject, but some seniors found potholes in her arguments. Class devoted to discussing service learning and topics of interest; reading needed for only 3 quizzes. Only hw reflections, annotated bib & final paper. Very passionate & clear. Follow directions, you'll get an A.",

Highly recommended class for all students, especially pre-meds. One of Duke's very best profs!", 
            "Great class, the most work outside of class is the mandatory service learning (2hr/week) but that is more fun than anything else. Make sure to participate in class and talk to her about your papers and you will do well.", 
            "She's an interesting lecturer and doesn't assign too much work, but does make you think. You'll question yourself in this class, and become a better person for it. It's not an automatic A, but it's not a hard class if you put effort into your papers. She's very helpful. Take classes with her. One of the best profs at Duke.", 
            "I took her Death and Dying course in the fall of 2005. It is one of the few courses that have stuck with me. She was insightful, helpful, and friendly. Her lessons extended beyond the course. I would take the course again if I could. By the way, I never found her grading to be strict or unreasonable. She gives you what you give her.",

            "I heard great things about Professor Gold and her class, Death and Dying, before this semester, so I chose to take her class. I have been disappointed. Class lecture has been repetitive and discussion stagnant. This, however, may be a symtom of the failure of sociology as a discipline.", 
            "Dr. Gold is a great person and someone you should take a course with. She does seem intimidating and fussy about attendance/requirements etc, but in reality she really cares about students and is extremely helpful. Paper grading is tough, but she will help you during office hours. The best part about her is her responsiveness to emails.",

He always answered email and usually within just a couple of hours. He would extend his office hrs if you weren't done. You could tell he understood if you had personal problems too. Great prof!", 
            "At first I didn't like Prof. Gross. He called out students for opening laptops, talking etc. Turned out I was able to pay attention in a big class like never before. He's very funny in an ironic way - freshmen don't get his humor AT ALL! If you want a good econ teacher who cares about teaching, take econ from this guy.",

But Tomberg explains everything very clearly and always welcomes questions. He is also really funny and friendly. The material is difficult but you will do well if you put in the effort.", 
            "Definitely one of the best math professors. Great lectures, crystal clear explanations. If you can't do well in the class it's only because you don't work hard enough. I want to be not only his student, but his friend.", 
            "Arguably the most difficult tests, but definitely the most rewarding class. Tomberg cares about his students and if you put in the effort he will do everything possible to help you succeed. I got D's on two of my tests and a C- on my third test, but was able to pull off a B+ on my final enabling me to achieve a B in the class. Thanks Tomberg!",

The grading is mostly quizzes but they were manageable with studying. Dr. Armaleo is very knowledgeable about what he teaches.", 
            "Would recommend for anyone truly interested in bio-His lectures were long, but also very interesting. You definitely have to study for the quizzes (which most of the grade is based on). I took this class before I took the other intro bio classes and found the info I learned here helped me out a lot in those classes.",

            "Dr. A is crazy smart, but also just plain crazy. He was pretty chill about the fact that nobody paid attention, but he also had very few graded items and insanely boring lectures. Grading structure was very unclear (we weren't told what it was until the third to last lecture), but he definitely cares a lot.",

The presentation (30% of final grade) format was changed many times throughout the semester, although some people had already presented. Do not take this freshman seminar.", 
            "He's a nice professor who's willing to work with you. Honestly, this freshman seminar was the worst class I took all semester. It's 2 hours, twice a week and he uses every minute and more. Though the grades are based on quizzes and presentations, he grades them a little harshly. The labs & lectures can be interesting but are long and tedious.",

I cannot stand bio though, and DA isn't the kind of teacher you want if you want lectures to be captivating. That being said, he is insanely smart and knows everything about bio. Pay attention in class and the class isnt bad.", 
            "Dr. Armaleo cares about each student in the class. You will learn how to write scientifically through trial and error and he will guide you in each step of the process. Will expect much of you, and that is reflected in his tough grading, but it is so that you can be the best researcher possible. Lectures/labs were hilarious, and he is accessible", 
            "Truly a hidden gem of the department. Really cares about his students + is willing to go beyond required accommodations if you need them despite seeming old school. Will interrupt you if you don't get right to the point he's looking for when you're answering a question but it's not personal. Class with DA is a must-take for future researchers", 
            "From what I heard, this class was significantly more work and stressful than most freshman seminars. I would NOT recommend this course for pre-meds/anyone who cares about their GPA as he didn't even give us our grade breakdown until 3 days before LDOC. He's a #gr8 guy & v enthusiastic about bio so if ur SUPER into bio go for it, if not save urself", 
            "Highly recommend. Dr. Armaleo is the perfect professor intelligent, thoughtful, comical, experienced, understanding. BIO214 is not easy but invest time and thought in each paper, and you will learn more in this class than in any other. Awesome pasta party at the end (Armaleo is Italian) and some other interesting days in class... :-)", 
            "The class is frustrating at first, because it is four hours long, and a lot of that is him talking or students being grilled on the spot. He also destroys your papers, but only because he cares and invests a lot in his students. I ended up being really glad I took the course, and I learned a lot about writing and scientific communication.", 
            "Awesome and hilarious. When you're from the eternal city, your humor has got to be on a whole other level! His energy and dedication to teaching is unparalleled. The most memorable and thought provoking class in biology. I'm 5 years out of college, and I still remember how fun this class was.",

Hilarious professor, and challenge you to get out of your comfort zone to learn. Extremely helpful during 1 on 1 interactions; always trying to improve teaching. My scientific writing improved tremendously with him.", 
            "Not really as hard as people make it out to seem. Well, that really depends on your writing ability: good writers will cruise in this class. That being said, lectures are extremely long and boring. He mostly just yells and makes fun of people for 8 hrs each week: this can be entertaining at times, but it's mostly tiresome. Don't learn a lot either.",

Also there was a lot of extra credit so you always had a chance to improve your grade. I would recommend Intro with her.", 
            "Thank baby-jesus for Prof Nelson! Some haters writing in here about Prof N dont like creative professors. If you need things spoon fed to you & want someone to inject powerpoint blahness into your head, look elsewhere. Don't blame this brilliant passionate teacher for breaking with the ho-hum textbook world. She inspired me & anth changed my life!", 
            "Professor Nelson is rather crazy at times, but most of the time gets the point across. She lacks organization and clarity when it comes to assignments and tests, which is annoying. Despite her saying that we shouldn't be students who regurgitate the information she tells us, that was the only way to get a good grade. Somewhat fishy.", 
            "If you're in school for grades and assignments, you'll hate this class. If you're in it to learn and get new perspectives, you'll love it. This class changed my outlook on the world. CA94 is an unconventional and fairly disorganized class, but if you do the assignments you'll be fine grade-wise. Definitely worth taking.", 
            "A brilliant and inspiring woman, but somewhat disorganized. Still, a great class with a really thought provoking selection of readings and in class activities.", 
            "To be honest, the workload was kind of ridiculous. Prof. Nelson gave out TONS of readings which were not really necessary. However, this was an interesting class and you could do well and learn A LOT if you worked hard.", 
            "Prof Nelson is very enthusiastic about her work, nevertheless, the class did not have any structure, lacked clarity of instruction, and had literally no grading system/ assessment criteria.The amount of reading is unreasonable for such a big lecture with little participation. Nelson's way of teaching is amusing, and material is at times interesting", 
            "She really made me think..very engaging. Probably my favorite class this semester.", 
            "The worst professor I have ever had. Lectures are incomprehensible and follow no clear order. Readings are not adequately discussed in class. Writing assignments are ambiguous. Grading is the mos ridiculous part of the class because it is unclear, and you are never sure what your grade is. AVOID THIS CLASS!", 
            "Nelson is a terrible instructor... let's just leave it at that.", 
            "I really loved this class at first, but as the semester has progressed it has become dull and annoying. She is incoherent and unhelpful, her grading is hard to understand, the readings are all over the place, and her assignments are overly taxing. I have an A and I still hate this class. Such a disappointment, do not take Nelson's CulAnth94", 
            "Well...I came in with high expectations for this class, but Diane shut them down quickly. She is really nice don't get me wrong but the incoherency of the lectures paired with the rare, but nearly impossible written assignments made for a terrible class experience. There was little guidance for the assignments and no grading system!", 
            "AVOID THIS CLASS! Reading assignments are ridiculous, her grading system is impossible to understand (she refuses to use letter grades), there are several annoying group projects, and the class is completely unorganized. This class took up more of my time and was less interesting than orgo - that should say something.", 
            "I feel as if many of these comments are out of revenge for the 7000 word take home exam, as they are all around the same date and sing the same tune..The exam which she later shortened and gave extra credit for parts of. The workload is NOT that bad. If you just do the minimum she asks, you can get an A.", 
            "In this class, you never know what the professor expects on assignments. The paper topics are vague and the grading methods are incredibly subjective. The readings are long and slightly pointless and the lectures are hard to follow. The TAs are rarely helpful and Diane is even less so. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS."

            "Good professor who cares about her students and wants you to succeed. Be sure to do the readings, watch the movies, and know your stuff extremely well or she'll think you didn't do any of it and penalize the entire class.", 
            "Madame Florand is fantastic! She does a great job of shaping class discussions around the material (almost all of which was very interesting) and letting students share their thoughts. Was always in a great mood and made the classroom a very welcoming environment. Would definitely take her class again!", 
            "She did a great job explaining the details of grammar topics, and always gave plenty of time for individual feedback on writing assignments. Great professor!", 
            "Madame Florand is a lovely woman, very caring about her students. She really wants you to do well. She doesn't post her powerpoints and the quizzes are difficult, but most of the writing assignments are short and quite enjoyable.", 
            "Madame Florand was a great French professor! She came to class every day with a cheerful attitude, she was very clear in her expectations all semester, and her workload was manageable. She was a very fair grader, always giving feedback along the way. Would highly recommend taking a class with her.", 
            "daily grammar hw for completion,5 essays total - reviewed them in class & gave feedback. For 1st 2 essays, edited our final essays& let us turn them in again.) 4 grammar quizzes. A little more work than other lang. classes but not a hard grader/participation counts a lot so u can't skip. worked to make our class very tight-knit. understanding/kind!", 
            "Fun fact: Madame Florand is also an award-winning novelist! Which is a cool aspect I wish more students knew. Adv. Writing Workshop was a fun class where you just learn about 5 different writing styles, with some grammar review in between. Very reasonable workload. SHe really works to make a great small group learning environment, would recommend!!", 
            "Madame Florand made French, a class that I did not much enjoy in high school, one of my favorite classes of my first semester freshman year. She is understanding, flexible, and always willing to help you out. Her tests and essays are also very fair. Lastly, she comes to every class enthusiastic and I have never seen her in a bad mood.", 
            "Mme Florand is the sweetest and most understanding teacher ever. I had her for French 76 as a freshman and I am so glad I got her class. There is grammar homework every night, but it's fairly routine and easy. The films studied in class are interesting and varied. The exams are not too bad either and re-writes are available for essays.", 
            "Real nice and fairly standard.", 
            "Best french professor I've ever had.", 
            "Awesome!", 
            "I LOVE Mme Florand! Having had her for both 63 and 76, I can say that she is a great, interesting professor, a fair grader, kind and understanding, and always available if you need extra help. There is consistently homework every night, but none is too difficult. She lets you rewrite your papers, which is great. Highly recommended!", 
            "Florand almost killed my love of French. She always insisted on insipid groupwork. The sketch project was a huge time drain & frustration. The class's tone was also thoroughly anti-Semitic. Some texts used Jewish stereotypes, & Florand told us it was hard for the French to think of the Nazis as bad people, since they were so charming in person!", 
            "You will have a lot of work and you need to do it in order to participate in class but Florand is very fair. I didn't like the class the first few weeks but by mid-semester I loved it. Do your blog weekly or you'll regret it in the end. Shes really helpful if you talk to her and if you can handle the work, def a prof I recommend.", 
            "Florand is very nice and a great techer but she is a ton of work and somewhat expects French to be your world all semester. I'd recommend her as a great teacher but not someone I'd choose if I'm just trying to get my language requirement fulfilled", 
            "She is really uptight", 
            "Madame Florand is a really great French teacher. She makes class interesting and has a creative teaching style. The work isn't too hard and she isn't a very hard grader. Recommended.", 
            "This class was mostly grammar review, so it's relatively easy if you have a strong background. There are daily homeworks, and all grammar must be self-studied. Classes were generally based on speaking, which was very helpful. The tests and papers were fair, as was the grading. Prof. Florand encouraged participation and taught very well."

His teaching wasn't always the most interesting, but it was clear that he was passionate about the material and he always responded to emails!", 
            "He deserves a 3.5. I'm just giving him a 5 here to boost up the rating. Definitely not a 1.9, he gives you the material straight/gets the job done. Pretty easy to do well.", 
            "Mark is quite the guy. Not the best lecturer and can definitely be dry sometimes but in all honesty not the worst at teaching material. His tests though have questions that are so ambigious and can trip you up so easily even though you fully comprehend the material. Can be super frustrating... don't expect to do well without putting in the time.", 
            "Dr. Rausher's lectures are pretty dry, and he's not very approachable if you want questions answered. He also does in-class exercises, which are a drag because you have to be present in every class to get the credit.", 
            "Professor Rausher is incredibly kind and helpful. His expectations are clear, and you should be able to prepare well if you study the PPTs. He is very communicative and responds promptly and in depth to doubts. He also shows us interesting videos. I really enjoyed learning from him.", 
            "Engaging lectures, good sense of humor, approachable, knowledgeable, and clearly passionate about the subject. Would take this class again.", 
            "Yikes. Boring lectures that are a mess. Don't take his classes. you'll just get frustrated and annoyed, which being bored. he tries though. But still a no from me.", 
            "I feel bad for Rausher; he's a nice guy with a passion for biology, but his lectures are some of the most droll lifeless things I've ever been through. The class is co-taught by him and Dr. B., and there is no textbook, just all-encompassing powerpoints, which make going to lecture with him near pointless. The class is not curved - beware of that.", 
            "His lectures are extremely confusing. He is so fast paced that if you look down for 2 seconds you miss 20 slides! Absolutely terrible lecturer, makes the subject harder than it actually is and can't explain anything to any student who asks a question that deviates just a tiny bit from what he is teaching. Worst professor here", 
            "Here's an updated review of Rausher as an instructor: Noor and Rausher co-taught Bio 202 this semester. While Rausher had unnecessarily convoluted explanations for simple concepts, he put in a good effort to help us learn the material and was always willing to clarify. If you really knew the material, his lectures helped more than they harmed.", 
            "One of the worst professors at Duke University.", 
            "I loved Rausher's lecture style. He gets right to the point and is very clear about what should be learned from his lectures. Yes, the material was dry and a little difficult, but that doesn't say anything about him as a professor. If you thoroughly go over the readings before class, I think you'll find his lectures to be as clear as I did.", 
            "His exams are very difficult. Also, he expects most of the material to be learned on one's own outside of class from his readings. In class lectures not very helpful. Avoid his class if you want to get a good grade in Bio 202!", 
            "Lectures are unhelpful. Assigned textbook was useless. At least 3 typos per exam. Picks on students in a large lecture class. AVOID AT ALL COST.", 
            "DO NOT TAKE BIO 202 WITH RAUSHER. He has NO idea how to teach and will make a class that is supposed to be easy and simple frustrating, bewildering and difficult (he does not explain concepts AT ALL). Spare yourself the pain and take it with Noor, TRUST ME.", 
            "Avoid at all costs.", 
            "Rausher is one of the worst professors I have had at Duke. He wrote his own textbook, which is full of derivations of formulas but no explanations of how to actually use them. He constantly contradicts himself and changes up details in his problems that will definitely screw you up. Extremely unclear and unhelpful. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.", 
            "Worst prof I've ever had. I go to every class and come prepared. Yet I find that I might as well stay at home & watch TV for all the good that his lectures do. He confuses you instead of clarifying. His exams are fraught with errors and he doesn't like to provide explanations when you ask about something you got wrong. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.", 
            "Really horrible lecturer. Focuses on equations and doesn't explain how to use them properly. Problem sets don't focus properly on what was presented in lecture, and seemed almost impossible to complete at times. Students are better off learning the lectures in their free time rather than going to class.", 
            "Dr. Rausher was the worst professor I have had during my Duke career. He gets angry when you ask him questions and is not reachable outside of class. He doesn't even make an effort to try to understand his students. I don't know why Duke still allows him to teach."

            "In Race and Public Policy he was super engaging and communicated the difficult material in an engaging way. However, there were a lot of readings- but if you are going to do Focus I 100% recommend", 
            "Adam was incredibly well-spoken, intelligent, and willing to teach without making students feel ignorant. Would definitely recommend, you will learn so much !", 
            "Adam is one of the smartest professors I've ever met. He has a breadth of knowledge and experiences, is really well read, and is eager to share what he thinks with his students. He sets clear classroom expectations. Although the work piles up, the deadlines for major projects are flexible. Highly recommend taking one of his classes while at Duke", 
            "He is a great professor who truly cares about his students. He also provided the class with really interesting readings! I RECOMMEND IT!!!!!", 
            "Great class! You'll learn a lot about race and yourself through the discussions. The work is not easy, but if you do whats expected you'll do well. It greatly helps critical thinking and writing skills.", 
            "Professor Hollowell is outstanding. He does a phenomenal job stimulating class discussions, challenging our ideas, and making us realize both our responsibilities and limitations. The topics are relevant, the readings are interesting, and the guests speakers are engaging. This is a must take class for anyone at Duke.", 
            "Amazing professor-very engaging, works hard to incorporate topics relevant to students, and invites interesting speakers to provide a wide range of perspectives in class. There's lots of reading, but everything is intriguing and relevant to class. DEFINITELY WOULD RECOMMEND!!!!", 
            "Race and Public Policy (a Focus class) was by far my favorite class this semester. Adam assigned interesting (albeit involved) readings every class, and pushed students out of our comfort zones in each discussion. He also made sure we had input as to what we read. This class gave me a better idea of what I want to do with my life. Adam is awesome.", 
            "Adam is an all round great professor and I learnt so much from taking his Race and Public Policy FOCUS class. Class discussions are always interesting and engaging, and he's not afraid of making you talk about the hard questions (which I thought was great). This class is very reading-heavy but all the readings are thought-provoking and rewarding.", 
            "This class (Race and Public Policy) was taken as part of the American Experience focus, and it was absolutely amazing! It opened my mind to be better able to examine both the outside world and my personal thoughts and perspectives. Adam was a fantastic professor, if a little disorganized at times, and I would definitely recommend taking his class!", 
            "A great professor that never ceases to challenge his students. In his class, you will be challenged intellectually like never before. A great listener and discussion leader. He is always readily available to assist in any questions students may have.",

There is a significant amount of reading, but it is fairly interesting, and the writing assignments/exams are fair. Would recommend taking a class with him.", 
            "Easily the best class I have taken at Duke. No matter your department or major, take this class.", 
            "While this class doesn't necessarily seem like a public policy class, it gives you the chance to expand how you think about different policies and institutions and will challenge your conceptions of service in a really productive way. Definitely would recommend.", 
            "I love Adam's class, and I'm rating him a 5.0, and I'm not giving him those stars just because he's white, male, and English is his first language. He is genuinely one of the best professors I've had at Duke and his class is amazing. Don't let the readings and grades scare you. I think everyone at Duke should take this class before they graduate.", 
            "Engaging, interesting, valuable experience. Adam is the kind of professor who challenges you to think about the ways in which you engage with service work. It questions the savior complex along with cynicism. I highly recommend this course (it's also not too hard, with a few easy quizzes, papers, etc ...", 
            "I 0/10 recommend this class. While the course is taught like a seminar (aka it's discussion-based), I would hesitate to call what goes on in Adam's classroom a discussion. Adam allows those who share the views he presents in class to speak and reinforces their ideas, while shutting down others. This should be a classroom, not a church.", 
            "This class is an awesome opportunity to hear a professor confront and question the many events that happen on Duke's campus and more. He is an exceptional lecturer, but can also be brash. I think this is a must-take for many Duke students."

Everything you need to know is covered in lecture; textbook's good for reading more on things you don't get and for practice problems. USE THE OLD EXAMS TO STUDY!",

He tries to make you laugh.",

Def have to work for it, but his midterms are just like the past hour exams so study those really well. Lots of hours need to be put in outside of class to really understand the material but very rewarding in the end.", 
            "Dr. Baldwin was an amazing professor who somehow made Orgo an enjoyable experience. Like the previous reviewer attested, he hands out extremely fair examinations. Do his old hour exams that he posts, as those tend to reflect the styles of questions that'll appear on your exams. The final is essentially an amalgamation of his hour exams but harder.", 
            "This man is a gem of a professor: amazing teacher, hilarious, and gives VERY fair exams based on material. Would recommend taking notes before class and going to lecture to just learn the material you need for the exams. Overall, makes orgo an enjoyable experience.", 
            "Absolutely amazing professor. Lectures on the important information from the book and adds some of his own information not from the book so 100% go to lecture.

I think Baldwin is a fine professor and gives decent lectures, but I found him very unhelpful outside of class and he expects a lot of you. I recommend getting a tutor and being ready to read and learn outside his classroom.",

His lectures can be a little dry and it's easy to get lost, but once you read the chapters and actually understand the material, you realize that his lectures are very thorough and he focuses on what he will test you on. Tests can definitely be tricky, but I think he is a fair professor.",

His three hour exams are 100% fair. The last two are challenging, but everything on there is stuff that he went over in class - no surprises. He made orgo 20x less miserable.",

            "Guy oozes charisma and makes even the most boring physics concepts interesting. Throws in personal anecdotes that are often quite amusing. Very helpful in office hours. Structure of class is a bit chaotic due to lack of consistency across TAs and the prof. Quizzes can be rough. Him and Derek are the Holy Duo.", 
            "Roy is a phenomenal professor and very passionate about the topic. He was able to make very complex physics objectives easier to understand (his lecture explanations are arguably better than the textbook). Lectures are easy to follow, and the lecture notes are very reflective of exams.", 
            "Arya Roy is a good lecturer (would recommend going if you can sit through a physics lecture) and very accessible outside of class in office hours. He is pretty disorganized and not in good contact with the TAs that do the homework and lead discussions, so prepare for some occasional confusion.", 
            "Arya Roy is simply AWESOME! Lectures are dope and really make understanding the material better. The weekly quizzes are pretty difficult . Definitely can't walk in without studying for them unless you are already a master in physics. Usually gives one hard midterm and one easier midterm. Final was very difficult. Overall, great class but not easy!!", 
            "Roy is the best lecturer I ever had. He has such a deep understanding of physics and cares a lot about his students. Go to lectures and go to office hours. He has the ability to explain physics like no other professor. Funny guy too", 
            "just god", 
            "This class was one of the hardest ones I've ever taken, mostly because I failed the first exam, but Roy was always there to help me and really tried to make sure I understood the material. He's one of the smartest people I know, but a bit unorganized. Tests are tough, as he wants you to truly understand things instead of crunching numbers. 10/10", 
            "Roys lectures are very well clear and his way of explaining things ensures conceptual understanding rather than memorizing. He usually ties in 1 or 2 interesting practical applications of the theory. Hes very engaging with students and he seems very passionate about the subject. A bit disorganized and tests are tough but manageable.", 
            "Great lecturer. he's kind of a mess, but so smart that he can literally improvise his lectures on the spot and have them be great. very personable and charismatic. all girls end up crushing on him for some reason. very willing to help. his tests make sense from what lecture and homework contain. I just wish there were clear legible answer keys.", 
            "Arya Roy is an incredible lecturer. Unlike a lot of my other engineering classes at Duke, I actually feel like I learn how to do problems live in lecture. Roy cares that we understand the concepts and that we can do more than crunch numbers. Stay after class to ask questions so that he knows your face.", 
            "Only issue I take is with lack of organization in lectures. A typical lecture from him involves a lot of intuition to eventually achieve some kind of result-the problem I have is that I never know what I am supposed to take away. Have we made a definitive statement? Is this result for a specific case? If so, what assumptions have we made?", 
            "I love the way Dr. Roy structured his class. It allows students to engage with the material in the way that's best for them while the weekly quizzes allow you to have consistent feedback about how you're understanding the material. He was very clear about how he presented material and very patient when helping.", 
            "Roy is an absolute godsend - he makes physics so easy to understand and he makes you want to come to class and learn. You'll leave the class learning so much more than just introductory physics, absolutely worth the work and worth the effort.", 
            "Professor Roy is truly one of the best professors at Duke, even though I skipped most of the lectures as I already knew the material. He makes you understand the concepts rather than memorize equations, which makes Physics 151DL a very challenging class for those who don't have a background in physics.", 
            "A professor who makes the lectures interesting. Roy is super focused on the geometrical meanings of the proofs and problems, and he gives out a good illustration. Lectures and problems are generally not hard, and he gives out notes to help understanding. Super willing to help people. Textbook is used, but you can survive without it.", 
            "Definitely the best teacher I've had so far at Duke. PHENOMENAL lecturer... please show up to his classes because he's what makes the tuition worth paying. The class is challenging with those who haven't had a lot of past physics, but it is very possible to do well if you work hard.", 
            "He's an amazing dude that connects with his students and makes sure they understand concepts rather than memorize equations. 10/10 would take again.", 
            "Arya makes his lectures entertaining and easy to follow, but he also provides notes on sakai (so you don't need to be there to do well). Highly recommend going and FLUNCHing him.", 
            "Arya has a great physics mind but leans towards teaching theory rather than practical examples, which can be frustrating for an \"engineering\" physics class. His homework is much harder than the test or quiz problems, but sometimes he'll throw something weird in there you've never seen before so study carefully.", 
            "Every lecture was like getting your mind blown for an hour! The homework was hard, but Arya's awesome explanations as well as overall hilarity was a great combo!"

Honestly is the amount of work of a full class, but I think most (if not every) kid got an A by the end of year bump. I'd take it the course if you're on the edge, at least because it also acts as a study hall of sorts to review what you learn in lecture.", 
            "He's put a lot of work into creating this lab course, and it's phenomenal. Math 218 is meant to be application based for cs/econ, and his lab course truly is (the actual courses much less so). It's more work than you would expect for a half-credit course but it's worth every bit. He gives very fair feedback and is genuinely an amazing teacher.", 
            "Rann really cares about his students and takes the time to make sure everyone is up to speed before moving onto the next topic. He will come to class early to write explanations for the day's lab on the chalkboard and explains clearly how concepts from the main class (Math 218) can be written into algorithms and applied in the real world.", 
            "Professor Baron is very accessible via email and during office hours and goes out of his way to make sure all students are accommodated for. He's very knowledgeable on the topic (linear alg is by no means an easy topic, but he summarizes concepts well) and always leaves time for student questions during and after lectures.", 
            "Great professor who makes concepts understandable and is extremely accessible outside of class. Lectures move a bit fast but textbook is a good supplement.", 
            "Rann is an amazing linear teacher - couldn't recommend more. If you really don't understand something, go and speak to him (he's always happy to help).", 
            "I liked the class. He's a personable guy. He teaches for you to understand concepts more than just solving problems. Use the help room and study groups as well to more fully understand concepts and you'll do well in his class. You don't have to do textbook problems to pass. Make sure to do the handouts he gives in class.", 
            "Class is not easy but Professor Bar-On is not only a great lecturer, but more importantly, a genuinely awesome human being. I should have come to office hour more often!!", 
            "Professor Bar-On is easily one of the most caring professors at Duke. He really wants his students to succeed and is very accessible outside of class. The material is difficult, but he will do everything in his power to help you do your best. Take a class with him. It's so inspirational and special to have a professor who cares so much about you!!!", 
            "Rann is an amazing professor, the complete anti-stereotype to the typical Duke math professor. This class is obviously difficult, but Rann will make every effort to help you excell and was one of the most accessible teachers Ive had at Duke. Hes just a genuinely amazing guy! PS Take his labs!! You wont find anything like them again at Duke.", 
            "Duke should be so happy to have Rann. When you see someone with such passion for a subject you can't help but reciprocate. This has been my favorite class, and I really hope that I will have the privilege to take another math class with Rann before I graduate. The class is obviously difficult, but Rann made it a wonderful experience.", 
            "Really great guy in general. Material is tough, but he'll help you through it if you put in the effort.",

            "Rann is a great math professor with a deep understanding of the material. Lectures are critical to understanding the material and Rann is always available and eager to help students. One of the most thoughtful and helpful teachers at Duke. Tests were reasonable, as well. This class isnt easy but if you reach out Rann will help you.",

His lectures are well-structured, the labs he designed are super fun (I really found great joy in them), and he is truly a cool and kind person. Helped me feel more confident in and appreciate Math! Not enough words but loved LA this sem!", 
            "Rann was one of my favorite professors at Duke so far. He truly cares about all of his students and wants to see us succeed. Math 218 is definitely not an easy class, but I think Rann did a great job with the course.", 
            "Rann is one of the most genuinely caring professors on this campus. He puts in a lot of effort to make himself accessible to students outside of class. Probably one of the sweetest and most intelligent people I've met in my life.",

He is also super accessible through his office hours, which are really helpful.",

His class is a lot of work, with weekly quizzes and three midterms plus a final, but he preps you well. Discussion sections are required, but entirely useless. Overall though, great class.", 
            "218 with Fitz is awesome. hes funny and a literal genius. the clearest teacher Ive ever had. This class will likely be my first where I won't be close to the A range, but I would take it again in a heartbeat. grading is exceptionally fair, and the tests are tough but representative of what you know. couldnt recommend this class more. take it.", 
            "He does not assign too much HW and his exams are computation heavy (work fast) but representative of the lectures. He helped me become better at deriving formulas instead of simply memorizing them. Definitely take Math 218 with him.", 
            "Fitzpatrick is far and away the best professor I've ever had for a math class. The class covers a lot of ground and every week builds on material covered in preceding weeks, so you need to keep up. Exams make up most of the grade, but the homeworks are useful practice. Super funny, accessible through email and office hours10/10 would recommend!", 
            "Fitz is an amazing lecturer, is clear and understandable and stops lecture for anyone with a question. He was clear with grading and was available outside class where he would gladly answer anyone's questions. He genuinely cares about students' success. The class was very difficult, however, and you have to put in the work if you want to do well.", 
            "Not the best lecturer, read off the slides. He went fast through lectures so it was easy to get lost in what he was saying. Weekly quizzes but they were not worth a lot. Very useful to do the homework but it's not mandatory. Tests were challenging, try to get copies from previous semesters to prepare.", 
            "Great professor. If you study the slides, prepare for the quizzes and understand how each topic pivots to the next, you'll do great. By far my most enjoyable math experience at Duke. Make sure to continuously revisit past material - it builds up pretty quickly.", 
            "I thought Brian was great - his lectures are very clear, and he is good at answering questions about the material. Office hours are helpful for completing the homework or just trying to understand concepts better. Tests aren't easy but are graded fairly. Plus, his occasional tangents can be hilarious!", 
            "Brian's a great professor. I really recommend going to lecture -- it was helpful to me and Brian does his best to make sure the material's clear. Attendance and homework are optional, so weekly quizzes and exams make up the bulk of the grade. The weekly quizzes are straightforward and midterms are fairly doable. Work hard, and you'll be fine",

The homework he assigns is not very representative of the test difficulty though. There have been several questions on each test that required on the spot creativity, which is especially difficult under strict time pressure (v. long tests)", 
            "Math at Duke is very difficult, but Brian is definitely one of the best professors and explains concepts very clearly. The exams are much harder than the homework, and there are weekly homework quizzes and discussion assignments, but it's a relatively manageable class . Definitely take this class with him if possible.",

            "Fitzpatrick is an excellent teacher. What he writes on the board is what you need to know, so showing up to lecture is essential. HW is lengthy at first, but textbook solutions are online and the AHP answers are given in discussion. The test questions are straightforward and follow practice problems done in class. Doing old practice exams is key",

To give you an example, I once emailed him about a question I had on the material. He came to class 15 minutes early and made an entire presentation just to answer my question. He truly is one of a kind.", 
            "Professor Thomas is a great professor, and I would recommend you take the class with him. The class is not easy, but Professor Thomas is really good at engaging students to make sure everyone understands the material. There are problem sets every other week that take a lot of time, but if you are on top of your work, it is not too bad", 
            "Prof. Thomas is funny and really cares about his students. His class really pushes you to think critically about econometric modeling. Its a pretty fast-paced lecture, but he always makes sure everyone is following. Problem sets can be lengthy, but are only due every other week, and they prepare you more for the exam than in any other class.", 
            "I had a great time taking Econometrics with Prof. Thomas. He does an excellent job in conveying the concepts and structuring lectures in a very logical order. Although the material itself is quite challenging, once mastered, it will be easy to realize why he says the class will benefit you later on.", 
            "Professor Thomas' econometrics class is incredibly stimulating. It's hard and his expectations are high but the lectures are designed to make sure everyone can keep up and he makes it very interactive. If you don't pay attention, he will notice but if you work hard, you will leave understanding much more about economics than just econometrics.", 
            "He is very cynical, but it grows on you. He makes fun of economists, the class, the university, and by the end I suddenly felt like I understood the real world of economics rather than a bunch of equations simplified and dumbed down for students, as I felt in even the most advanced econ classes before this one. Pay attention. Pays off big-time.", 
            "I highly recommend taking this class with Professor Thomas. His lectures are incredibly well designed and really encourages students to stay engaged and always ask questions. Huge focus on actually learning the material instead of just last minute cramming for exams. It's a rare treat to take a class as intellectually stimulating as this one.", 
            "This course is unequivocally thrilling. He shows you the intuition and the math behind all of the major quantitative analysis techniques-- allowing people who are both less and more mathematically inclined to \"get it.\" This class is not the hell that people call it-- go over the slides, go to office hours and talk to him. An A is well within reach.",

Duncan is caring, takes great care in designing the syllabus and his slides, and always goes an extra mile to make sure everyone is on the same page. Participate a lot, show that you understand the material, and you will get the grade you deserve",

If you put in time and work, you will succeed. Unequivocally, ECON208 is the best of the core Economics classes. Also one of the great intellectual challenges of the department. A very rewarding semester.",

I therefore recommend the class to anyone who actually wants to move past the bs and actually understand how soc sci/humanities research works. The prof also comes with a great sense of humor.", 
            "Professor Thomas is an amazing teacher! He explains the difficult econometrics concepts so well, and stresses the importance of building intuition as opposed to cramming formulas. Take this class with him, and you would truly learn concepts that you can apply in the future.", 
            "Professor Thomas is great. He truly cares about the students and is always willing to help. Not only can you expect to learn a lot from the lectures but also the problem sets. You can tell he spent tremendous time and effort in preparing for the lectures and designing the problem sets. The class is hard and demanding but that's how you learn stuff.", 
            "Professor Thomas is phenomenal. It's no secret 208 is a dreaded class, but he gives you the sense he's there with you step-by-step throughout the semester. He clearly cares about the kids in his lecture, and while the material is difficult he does a surprisingly good job of contextualizing it. If you can't take 208 abroad, take it with him.", 
            "Really good professor. Cares about his students, & most of all his students learning the content. One of the few Econ core classes I've taken where you absolutely need to go to class. He puts notes online, but the content is extremely difficult, & he does a great job teaching the material so class is necessary", 
            "Very inspiring and engaging lecturer. Really cares for students individually. Difficult material that is covered fast, but learned a lot in class. Favorite Economics class so far, and possibly the most applicable to any subject matter and life.",

            "I took Neuro101 with her, the first semester where she video recorded her lectures - this was SUPER helpful, and made attendance optional. I went to class everyday anyway since she was super funny and a great lecturer. She really cares and makes the topic accessible to students of all academic backgrounds! Would highly recommend taking her classes!", 
            "There is no need to get the textbook unless you want it or think you may need it in the future other neuroscience classes. The tests are fair . I suggest studying with a group to get the most out of studying. I would not call this an \"easy\" class, but with hard work, time, and dedication, you are destined to do well in this class!", 
            "Don't buy the textbook. No busy work in this class, the grade is solely based on four tests and a group paper. The tests are fairly difficult, but it gets easier when you learn her testing style. There is a lot of fascinating material covered, and you'll make some great friends through the final proposal. Not an easy A, but definitely manageable.", 
            "Dr. Murphy is a great human being and super knowledgeable. However, her tests are quite hard and I was somewhat frustrated about having bought a textbook that was literally unnecessary. Beware the rather harshly graded group writing proposal, but otherwise just pay attention to lecture--you will definitely learn a LOT of very interesting material.", 
            "Great professor! Lectures are recorded, but I recommend going (quality of the videos isn't great). Lectures can skip around a lot, so pay attention. Don't read the text book. 4 tests, mostly online, in class portions are sneaky tricky, but no final. Beware of the paper and actually try on it. I really should've gotten an A, just try on the tests.", 
            "Funny and easygoing lecturer, but she tries too hard to be \"fun\" and ends up skimming over a lot of the material. Tests then contain questions about the details she skipped. Telling students wrong info, then being unreachable for days while the class is confused on Piazza, is frequent. Her class is disorganized, and so are her discussions.", 
            "Dr Murphy is the best! She's a great lecturer and she likes to make corny jokes which i really appreciate. She's always willing to make appointments for you to meet with her outside of class and she will literally go over the powerpoints with you one slide at a time to make sure you understand the material. Great professor!", 
            "Great Professor. Easy grading. Discussion section was a bit of a joke.", 
            "Karen is a ray of sunshine--so positive, uplifting, enthusiastic and caring. She is there for you, will extend deadlines, and wants everyone to do well. Her tests (half take-home, half in-class) are designed to \"make you think\" but basically means that she accepts any answers you write as long as your logic makes sense. Must-take, relatively easy A", 
            "Karen's lectures are super disorganized and difficult to follow. The tests aren't too hard, but the questions are odd sometimes. The part I hated most about this class was the paper. It is barely mentioned in class, yet makes up a huge percentage of your grade and is graded very harshly. I ended up doing well, but this class is not an easy A.", 
            "Went into this thinking it would be an easy class, but unless you're a bio/psych major i wouldn't recommend. Tests were not very easy as many of the questions had very wishy washy answers", 
            "Murphy is definitely one of the most enthusiastic professors I've had at Duke, it's obvious that she cares both about the content of the class and her students. The class is easy to do well in, but definitely not an easy A.", 
            "Dr. Murphy is everything I could've asked for! She is super caring & accessible. Her lectures are great (and funny!) but you'll learn very little if you don't go to class. Discussion section was average and I'd have rather had another lecture instead to explore more cool stuff. Nothing is perfect but this is as close as you can get.", 
            "Karen is a wonderful woman, but her lectures are very disorganized and hard to follow. The tests aren't too difficult, but definitely not an easy A. Papers are graded harshly, make sure to put in adequate time for those.", 
            "Dr. Murphy is absolutely incredible. She went above and beyond when it came to being accessible for her students, and learned many by name. She is hilarious and the lectures are very interesting and funny. It's not an easy A, it takes work and studying, but she wants you to do well. She is one of the best professors I could've expected from Duke.", 
            "Murphy is amazing and very helpful (in class and on Piazza). The class material is very interesting and Murphy provides it in a very entertaining and easy to understand manner. Tests aren't too difficult. The paper is a bit of a drag but still manageable. Overall, one of the easier science classes at Duke.", 
            "Her class is pretty easy. She's super chill and she is an amazing lecturer. Attend her lecture! ! The online portion of her tests are open textbook, open internet, and open friends.. but it is hard and often need to read a lot journals and articles to back up each statement. In general it's a challenging class but you'll learn a lot.", 
            "Murphy will literally stay up all night on Piazza and answer all students' questions in a very prompt manner. That said, some of the material was very confusing and was not explained in the best/most efficient manner. Plus discussion section was pointless. Overall though I liked her and would definitely take another class of hers again.", 
            "Testing is half in-class and half online. Both are challenging. Just focus in her lectures because they are long and full of material. Love Dr. Murphy though, she loves teaching and is always willing to help.", 
            "Murphy is an interesting, funny, and effective lecturer. The class isn't too hard if you put in the work, because the in-class portions are easy and you can do well on the take-home parts because you are allowed to use friends and online sources. Overall, fantastic professor"

            "Can't teach. Duke needs to do a better job of differentiating researchers and teachers. Just because you performed extensive research in a subject does not make you a great 'teacher'. Learn how to simplify concepts and then get more detailed and intricate. Not everyone in the class came from high schools with strong Bio courses.", 
            "I know there's some controversy around her but I had her for both Bio 202 and Bio 420 and she was great. 420 was a lot better because she had the opportunity to dive into the details and she's clearly very knowledgable and really excited about the material. Her lectures are really good - easy to follow despite the amount of information. Great prof.", 
            "Dr. Bejsovec is very invested in making sure everyone succeeds. Her lectures are interesting and very funny. The class is fast-paced but there are lots of ways to make up your grade.", 
            "Dr. Amy is very knowledgable. She has a good grasp of the subject, and can answer doubts well, but is sometimes unable to simplify certain concepts since she conducts research at a high level. The class is very well organized. Overall, would recommend since even the support staff for this class is great.", 
            "Dr. B is an amazing professor and person, but she doesn't understand the difference between what an introductory bio class and a higher-level bio class needs to learn. Be prepared to learn a lot, a great deal more than AP Bio. All information you will need to know/be tested on are on her polished lecture slides.", 
            "Fall Sem., Bio 202. They upped the difficulty on this class so you have to work for the grade. She goes through a week of material in a single lecture, you walk in 5 mins late or zone out and you'll be completely lost. Class is unnecessarily hard, office hours with Mercer are unhelpful. She seems really cool/nice and passionate, but tough.", 
            "Dr. B is the queen of genetics. I would highly recommend taking class with her. She's one of the most passionate professors I've had at Duke. If you love genetics, you will love this class. She keeps lectures interesting and gives clear explanations of difficult topics. You have to understand the material and not memorize it to do well on midterms.", 
            "Prof. B is a great professor. Cancer genetics is a tough course with A LOT of info, but Amy does a fantastic job of explaining the content and making sure we understand. I easily learned way more in this course than any other Duke course. Reading the book is useful but not necessary; she only tests from the lectures.", 
            "I'm pretty sure that if you looked up the etymology of \"intense,\" it would somehow trickle back to Dr. B. She's nothing if not that, but she's also a great lecturer, who manages to explain concepts that can be quite confusing. This class is not for the faint of heart but you can learn a great deal from Dr. B if you choose to.", 
            "Dr. B really is here to teach and help her students learn the material. Her lectures are interesting and always geared towards why things are relevant. She's really helpful in office hours and by email for homework and studying. Her tests are tough but she's generous with partial credit.", 
            "Dr.B is great, she is always willing to help her students understand the material. She covers a lot of material every lecture so sometimes it is easy to get lost during class, so go to lectures and stay focused. The homework questions are good studying materials for the exams.", 
            "Dr. B was one of the best Biology professors I've had at Duke. Her class was very fast-paced but that's because of how much material there is. She's really passionate about the material and was very helpful both in & out of class. If you want to understand the hallmarks of cancer properly, take this class. Don't be lazy and expect to do well!", 
            "Amazing class and professor! Cancer bio covers every corner of cell biology, which can be overwhelming, but Dr. B presents it in an interesting and manageable fashion. There was always at least one hooking example or story each lecture that got me really interested in the material. Dr. B is very accessible and willing to help her students.", 
            "Dr. B's class can be intimidating at first, but only because there is so much to learn in each lecture. However, her powerpoints are incredibly clear and concise. If you put the work into the class, you will leave with a rewarding overview of Cancer Genetics. One of the few science classes I've taken that is directly applicable to medical school.", 
            "She's one of the most intelligent professors I've met at Duke. This class re-inspired my love for science and for pursuing medicine. It is easily one of the most useful and interesting classes I've ever taken. The Cancer Biology textbook is an incredible resource - use it wisely! Requires a lot of studying but exams were fair. Above an 85 = A-.", 
            "Great course and fantastic instruction. She does come off a bit cold sometimes and is unafraid to call people out for being wrong. Word of advice: don't ask questions or make comments simply to get a better participation grade because you will get owned. Think carefully before speaking...", 
            "Dr. B is a horrible teacher. I really wonder how she is still a professor at Duke. She is unclear in class and makes her tests way too hard for our level.", 
            "bejsovec is tough! her lectures go very, very fast, so i'd recommend taking a laptop or a recorder. she goes through so much material, and you really need to understand it all because her tests really are hard. do all the problems she suggests, and also read the book beforehand. but she definitely will help and responds to email q's fast", 
            "118 is a HARD class - you should know that coming in. I found Dr. B's lectures to be really interesting. Once I asked her a question after class, and by the time I'd walked to the bc she had already sent me an email explanation that she'd accidentally told me the wrong thing. I can think of plenty of professors who would NOT take that effort."

The class is curved to a B+ but the class also has very driven people so make sure you're one of them so you don't end up behind the pack.",

The class is really difficult and material builds fast, so avoid falling behind by going to TA sections. Your grade is essentially only test grades (though curved to a B+).", 
            "Nechyba is a very knowledgable professor who loves to teach. Holds extra review sessions even on Sundays before the tests. The class itself is very rigorous and the lectures tend to be very dry at some points. The textbook comes in handy a lot of times. His tests are insanely tough but I'd recommend taking the class with him only.",

            "This class was the hardest class I have taken so far. The lectures are very dense and the material is hard to understand. Nechyba is great/well versed on this topic, but his lectures/textbook tend to be unnecessarily wordy. Definitely recommend hitting up office hours (with Chelsea- she taught the class this spring) and spending time on the info",

He also wrote the textbook, which is very well written and becomes a valuable resource for mastering the material. The class is fast paced and tests are definitely hard, but there is a fairly lenient grading policy in place.", 
            "Great professor who truly cares about the material and student success. I never attended class as the in-class quizzes could be completed from anywhere. The book is a great resource for getting an in-depth understanding of the material. Exams are fairly difficult, but predictable if you review past exams. Material builds quickly.",

The class isn't easy and the material builds, but Nechyba is simply great at explaining tough concepts and makes himself very available before exams to help everyone out.",

It's a tough class, but if you put effort into it, you will do fine. Also, get maximum prepared for every exam, because your whole grade depends on two midterms and a final.",

Overall, a great teacher in a great class, and would definitely recommend him.", 
            "Moses was an excellent teacher. Very skilled facilitator of discussion, and able to supplement our discourse on novels with an astonishingly wide breadth of knowledge, particularly on movies, but also in history, art, pop culture, and more. All grading was done by TA's in this course.", 
            "Watch one movie a week and discuss during lectures -- I found lectures super interesting (I knew nothing about film) and Prof. Moses was super knowledgable. However, we wrote weekly response papers and 4 big papers throughout the semester which I personally found really challenging/time consuming. All grading is done by TAs.", 
            "Professor Moses is the most influential instructor I've had at Duke. Genuinely and overwhelmingly brilliant, his lectures are so multidisciplinary and informative that it's like learning on hyperdrive. He has a sense of humor, and if you have even an inkling of interest in any sort of literature, he will captivate you. Available and fair grader.", 
            "Professor Moses is excellent. He's not only a great professor, but he's an amazing human being.", 
            "Professor Moses is the best professor in the English Department, without question. In addition to his encyclopedia knowledge of literature and philosophy, he also has this warmth and gentleness of demeanour which drew me to his classes. There is also something very \"Hollywood\" about him-- it is as if he walked out of a Raymond Chandler flick.", 
            "This professor is incredibly smart and articulate. Grading was done by TAs and was kind of bs but Moses' lectures were generally interesting.", 
            "ONE OF MY BEST PROFS EVER. All Vision of Freedom profs are amazing, and Moses is no exception. He knows everything and offers constructive criticism rather than disdain/cynicism that a lot of professors in the vaguely polisci field like to do.", 
            "HOT", 
            "I took this class just because he's that awesome. I actually dislike Samuel Beckett, but Moses could be teaching about sewage and I'd enjoy it. If he could teach every class at Duke, life would be so much better. Taking one class with him is not enough. Not taking a class with him when you have a chance to is just foolish.", 
            "Michael Valdez Moses completes me. He is not only incredibly knowledgeable about everything (not just English!) but also very accessible and engaging. He was also helpful in organizing papers during office hours. He grades fairly easily and doesn't assign too much work. Definitely take his class.", 
            "Amazing professor, very knowledgeable and even funny (in the slightly ironic academic way, of course). Really recommend him to anyone looking for a well rounded presentation of pretty much any subject dealing with politics, literature etc...", 
            "He's amazing.", 
            "Amazing Professor, in every way possible. A must-take at Duke.", 
            "By far the smartest professor at Duke. He is hot, too. He knows absolutely everything about everything there is to know. If you are not an English major, it doesn't matter, he knows everything and will bring it all into his lecture, politics, religion, history, popular culture, sports. Whatever, Michael Valdez Moses knows it all.", 
            "I took the \"Visions of Freedom\" Focus class \"Liberty in Literature.\" Class is almost all poli sci (we read just 3 novels.) Moses lectures most of the time. He's brilliant, but it's not much of a seminar. You'll learn so much though. He's an easy grader, but he assigns a lot of work. He doesn't seem to like office hours, however.", 
            "Moses is pretty much a genius. He literally knows everything. I was sad when I found out there were like 40 ppl in this class and that most of it was lecture, but then I didn't care b/c the lectures were so good. He's also really nice! Take his classes.", 
            "A wealth of knowledge this man! And easy on the eyes for you ladies out there."

His class may be disorienting at first (a lot harder, depends more on participation) but your arabic will surely improve because of him. This class requires a lot of work outside of lecture and moves pretty quickly (a chapter a more a week). However, highly recommend Lo!", 
            "Lo genuinely wants students to learn, but his methods are frustrating. He deducts points for speaking English in class, but doesn't teach the vocabulary necessary to ask questions in Arabic. This discourages questions altogether, but he deflects any questions asked. Tons of homework, but if you want to learn Arabic, there aren't many other options.", 
            "If you like clear guidelines about grades and expectations, I would avoid Lo (and most of the Arabic department). He's super unclear about what he expects, and is SUPER disorganized. I also took part in the Morocco study abroad program he runs and it was the most disorganized mess I've ever experienced. No one knew what the plan was the whole trip.", 
            "Lo is an easy A, take him for Arabic.", 
            "Professor Lo has a great sense of humor, but he is also very wise. I learned so much not only about the Arabic language, but the culture of the Middle East as well. The class itself is very easy, and if you put in at least a little bit of effort you will likely get an A. My only complaint is that guidelines for assignments are sometimes unclear.", 
            "Dr. Lo is a great teacher - he's very accessible and willing to help. However, I personally thought he was vague with grading. He dodged a ton of points of my attendance, and didn't give extra credit points for things he said he would (such as attending Arabic events). I got solid A's on all exams and homework's, and still got barely an A- overall", 
            "Took Arabic with Lo but this was a culture class we took in Duke in the Arab World (Morocco). Class was kind of all over the place, there were interesting discussions but no real structure (Lo loves long tangents too). Syllabus was super vague and so were assignments. Lo is great but the class was unnecessary stress when abroad..", 
            "Lo is a really cool guy and I enjoyed the class. Arabic is a hard language, but he makes it relatively smooth. Grading is forgiving, make sure to go to his office hours if you miss a day, forget to turn in something, etc.. Don't think he gives anyone less than a B. Lectures are pretty confusing though and he tends to go off on tangents a lot a lot.", 
            "Arabic is a tough language and professor Lo takes you through it pretty fast paced. It's on you to keep up with the material. Be ready to devote lots of time to homeworks and just plain studying.", 
            "He's a great language professor for beginners. He's very helpful and wants to see people do well. The lowest grade he gives is a B+.", 
            "Professor Lo was a really wonderful professor. He is extremely passionate about the topic, and he is a wealth of information about the Middle East. He is not always clear and understandable. However, he is always open to meeting with students and addressing any concerns that they may have. Just be in class and on time!", 
            "Really helpful professor. He made Arabic so easy. He always brought some tea to the class and asked students to come to office hours if there was any difficulty.",

            "Ustaadh Lo is the best. Despite the fact that he is a troll and can be unclear at times, he has made Arabic 101 a fantastic experience. He curves the class heavily and his grades rarely reflect what the paper actually says. Do you homework and learn the vocab and you'll be fine.", 
            "Professor Lo is the man. He is very bright and knows a ton of languages, which is why sometimes he can be unclear but he is lenient with making up work/exams. Although Arabic can be hard, Lo is crazy lenient with grades (the lowest he gives out is B+, and thats to people who should fail). If you show that you are trying you will absolutely get an A", 
            "Professor Lo really pushes us, but he is also really accessible for any type of help. He really wants you to learn Arabic and to be interested in the culture. Just give some effort and he will give you a good grade. Sometimes he's a little unclear, but that's more of a cultural thing.", 
            "People have said that the class can be confusing. It definitely is, and some of that is resultant of communication. But that's deliberate, he throws us in over our heads and pushes us to work hard to move past that confusion. Really cares about each member of his class. He can be extremely funny. I recommend working with and getting to know him.", 
            "Professor Lo is an awesome person. Sure he's a bit disorganized and unclear with assignments, but he is so helpful if you work hard in the class and show interest. I really loved him he is such a great guy. Make sure you take Arabic because you want to and be willing to work hard or you will be disappointed in the class as a whole.", 
            "The worst professor I have ever had. Languages are my passion, and I am doing very well in his class, so this isn't revenge in that way. If his goal is to be utterly incompetent and discourage students i give him an A+. How is such an idiot at Duke?", 
            "Professor Lo is a genuinely nice guy and a relatively easy grader. However, he is not the most organized teacher and he is often extremely unclear when giving directions/answering questions.

On top of that, the content of the class is so interesting that it really makes you think and changes your perspective on things. The papers require a lot of effort but he gives clear feedback and an A is not that tough", 
            "Dr. Thompson has been my favorite professor during my time here at Duke so far. He is extremely caring about all of his students and is always available to talk outside of class for help on papers and even just life. If you want to have the opportunity to meet a professor who can change your life, I would definitely recommend this course.", 
            "Dr. Thompson was an amazing professor. He truly cares about each of his students and makes class very interesting. There are lengthy readings assigned that you don't necessarily have to read for class, but are definitely helpful/needed for essays. He is not a very harsh grader and gives specific feedback on rough drafts. Would rate 3.5 difficulty.", 
            "I enjoyed Professor Thompson because he made me think about my college experience from a new perspective. The workload is tough with readings every night and lengthy essays due. He is an amazing person and meeting with him outside of class was beneficial to understand how to best convey your thoughts on the essays. Great Professor!", 
            "Professor Thompson chooses readings (they're kinda lengthy) that are relevant to not only the discussions in class, but also to our experience as college students in general. Furthermore, he encourages you to meet with him outside of class just to talk or for help on papers. He is the kindest and most intelligent professor I've had at Duke.", 
            "I highly recommend this course. Professor Thompson is passionate about the subject material, facilitates a very welcoming and engaging conversation during each seminar, and is exceptionally caring and invested in his students. He is extremely helpful and gives detailed feedback for papers. I've learned so much in the class and it is worth it", 
            "Dr. Thompson has shaped my undergraduate career in so many ways. His freshman seminar covers interesting topics and discussions are thought-provoking, but his willingness and desire to help students is what makes him beyond so many other professors. He is by far the best professor I have had, and probably will have, at Duke. A must take class!",

            "Bob was a very caring professor; however, I didn't feel like I connected with him like many other students do. It is still noticeable that he genuinely cares about his students' well-being as well as their schoolwork. I spent many hours working on papers for this class, and some were rather lengthy. There are scholarly articles due every class.", 
            "Professor Thompson is the kind of professor that may change your life, or at the very least your undergraduate career. He's always willing to meet with students to help them revise papers, and doing so definitely benefits one's grade and learning. The class is not easy, but grading is fair and assignments are interesting. Will miss this class!",

The material we covered was made very central to all of our lives, and Dr. Thompson was great at both explaining material and helping us connect it to our own experiences. The readings for each session are a lot, but they are interesting and produce good reflection.", 
            "Dr. Thompson is such an incredible professor. He is so dedicated to his work, and shares his actual clinical tapes every class. He gives great feedback on all papers, and each paper has a non-graded rough draft component, which is really helpful to understand how to improve. He makes it a point to get to know his students, and is just really great.",

            "He was, and I expect will always be, my favorite professor. Though you do have to work in this class, it is extremely engaging and rewarding. He truly loves what he does and it shows. The manner in which he runs the class is extremely conducive to both learning and growing in the field of psychology. It's a must take class that you won't regret.", 
            "This class really changed the way I think, both because of the nature of the material but also because Professor Thompson is such an encouraging, insightful professor. I truly wish I could take this class again and hope to take at least one more class that's even close to the standard of this class.", 
            "Doctor Thompson is one of those professors that you will remember for all of your years at college, and maybe even beyond. While the class is challenging, you get out what you put in, and Dr. Thompson is always willing to meet with you and give great feedback on your papers. There is a lot of reading, but it's all interesting (for the most part).",

His readings are very extensive and difficult though, and be prepared to do some work if you want to get an A. The effort is definitely worth it.",

His expectations are clear and he is flexible and understanding. His lectures are awesome and he shares footage of some of his actual patients, which is really cool.", 
            "He is my favorite, most beloved, most amazing, and kindest prof I ever had! I still feel that he's my friend and mentor. His class gave me reflection, confidence, and inspirations. The only thing I regret is that I should have carefully read over all the assigned readings (he doesn't use a textbook, and readings are posted on sakai). DO READ IT."

The book is a good read as well, and tests/assignments were really quite doable.",

Read the book on your own because he won't review any of the grammar in class. Very self-taught class.",

The tests are tough, though all Duke Spanish 204 classes have the same tests, especially because there is no word bank for the vocab sections. Read the textbook grammar sections often!",

Doesn't spend much time teaching the grammar on the tests",

Classmates felt he was unclear, but I felt like they just weren't listening (or trying to listen) (It's true -- it's a Spanish class). If really needed, he would switch to English. And if there was something in Spanish I didn't quite understand, I could talk with him after class.",

Because of the SLP's grading system you need to be taught a certain way in order to do well and he doesn't do that. In all honesty he doesn't really teach you antything.",

Lectures are mostly very clear, but do make sure you understand details that might seem insignificant. Exams tended to be more similar to previous years' tests than to sample problems, but do practice, since the same questions won't be asked twice.", 
            "Professor Crumbliss is hands down the best teacher I've had at Duke. He is clear, kind and even gave a disclaimer before the exam that he is not here to trick us. I can't say enough positive things. I'm so happy he teaches at Duke! Crumbles love", 
            "You will want this man to teach you general chemistry.", 
            "Best science professor I've ever had. Tests what you know, not interested in what you don't know unlike many professors. He's so helpful and takes the time to make sure students really understand the material. Very practical. Take a class with him if you can!", 
            "Tests were tricky. Lectures were helpful and more engaging than Palmer's. Nice guy...connected with students better.", 
            "good guy, really interested in chemistry, really wants his students to succeed. His lectures are much clearer and more interesting than palmers. Overall, he knows his stuff and does a good job of teaching to his students",

Can't comment on his teaching ability because I didn't wanna get up at 7 AM, but the tests really aren't bad as long as you start studying before midnight. The final was harder though, but had a nice curve I'd imagine.", 
            "This class is kind of a pain; I felt like I was always doing work for chem between lab reports/homework/reading/prelabs/quizzes/studying, etc. however, they're not out to trick you; the material is (relatively) straightforward. If you study hard you will do well. Crumbliss' lectures are more important not to miss than Palmer's, in my opinion.",

            "This guy is the most boring guy ever. He never covers all the material he needs to in lecture and he repeats himself all the time. It is very frustrating. Palmer (who teaches the first half of this class) wasn't great, but he was much better than Crumbliss.", 
            "Overall horrible teacher, hard/tricky tests, boring lectures (though he didn't use powerpoint like palmer, so it was a bit easier to stay awake). Wasn't so bad that I didn't go to class, but definitely made genchem one of the worst experiences of my undergraduate career. A bit less intimidating than Palmer, though.",

            "For the most part follows the book. Maybe one question per test is not in the book. I thought he spent a little too much time doing examples on the board when similar/identical problems are in the textbook. Tests are good because they are as fair, though some found them tricky. Okay to skip lecture without missing too much",

Going to class is not a must, but Vieth does throw out the occasional (ungraded) pop quiz to assess attendance. Exams are easy if you read the textbook, and she gives study guides.",

If you pay attention in class and really memorize the powerpoints then you'll be fine. And before the test, read the sections she tells you to do. The tests were overly specific but easy for me since I memorized the information thoroughly.",

Overall enjoyed the class.",

There are pop quizzes in class, a lot of long emails with important information, and the tests are strictly memorization.

She does try to engage the lecture by making students tell jokes or talk in small groups. There are pop-quizzes, but they're worth minimal points and you get to drop one, so it's no big deal!",

I was actually struggling in the class until I went in for help. Very very helpful and sweet lady, and after our meeting, I brought my grade up to an A-. Now I'm considering majoring in psych - all because of her. Take her.", 
            "Very smart. Very nice. But like... there's an unnecessary massive amount of work and reading. If you take any other psych classes at Duke you just end up repeating the material so why does it all have to be accounted for in psy 101? Frustrating.",

His tests were primarily based on what was said in lecture, but my favorite thing about him was meeting after class over a snack to go through the readings for all interpretations. Cares a lot about his students and is very patient.", 
            "Professor's lectures are deep and insightful. The books are covered very fast, so it's important to stay on track with readings. Record lectures and make good notes since tests are based on what's discussed. Clear and objective grading. A is achievable if you work hard and manage time well.", 
            "Strandberg's lectures are legendary. Detailed analysis of the books, delivered in his trademark voice of God. Class is entirely test based, memorize what he says in lectures and you're guaranteed an A. You don't have to actually read anything. Go to class and take notes, he goes pretty fast.", 
            "Lectures were very interesting. Gives a lot of detailed analysis, both on the texts and on the authors and backgrounds. Tests were based entirely on his personal analysis of the text, but were also objectively graded. He goes very quickly, memorize what he says in lecture and you're guaranteed an A. You even don't have to actually read.", 
            "Strandberg is incredibly knowledgable on all of the authors he selects and can deliver a very engaging lecture. However be prepared to sit back and listen, take exams, and read. My criticism is that Victor doesn't encourage any critical engagement between students and the texts -- lectures only -- if you're looking for feedback, I'd pass.", 
            "I love Strandberg so much. I'm not an English major, and I was so inspired by his lectures and the information he includes outside of the book. One of my favorite Duke classes, I highly highly recommend it.", 
            "There should be no question: take Strandberg's class. Whatever he is teaching, take it. The man is a phenomenal professor and lecturer. Tests are based exactly on what he says in class. Write down exactly what he says and memorize it and you will get an A. If nothing else, the man has a legendary voice.", 
            "Strandberg is legendary. Take his class and you won't regret it. Best advice: read as much as you can in advance because he moves super quickly. If you take notes in class you're pretty much guaranteed an A. Plus his wonderful sonorous voice is a treat to listen to.",

            "Professor Strandberg is the best. This is my third class I've taken with him and I am planning to take another. His lectures are super easy, just show up, take notes & look through your notes before tests and you'll do fine. No essays for lectures. The seminars have essays but hes an easy grader so don't worry about it.",

There's only one optional term paper. He goes very fast and you cannot miss a class, however great readings and a passionate professor!",

            "Strandberg is the most interesting professor I've had in 4 years at Duke. He's not easy, but if you take notes and pay attention you shouldn't do worse than a B, and you could do better. But his lecture style and breadth of knowledge on his topics are extremely impressive, he cares about his students, and he has the Voice of God. Seriously.",

Seminar class didn't have much student participation, but it was still an amazing class. A great teacher if you want to approach a topic you normally find difficult.", 
            "His opinions on literature are interested and textually based. A smart and kind old professor, his exams are based solely on facts from the books and his lectures so the course should be an easy A if you have a good memory.",

Not too hard if you really pay attention during lecture, do the reading and study- but all of these things are necessary for doing well. Have to meet with him in his office and he videos you saying your name-creepy.",

Good class for non-English majors.",

            "Prof. Salsman is my favorite professor at Duke. This was the second course I have taken of his and if I was still in college I would take a third for sure. Salsman not only cares greatly about his students, but is the only professor that I have had who makes me excited to come to class/meetings ready to discuss readings or new findings and ideas.", 
            "Salsman is definitely one of the better professors at Duke. Definitely show up to lectures as he elaborates on the readings and helps you to draw connections between different scholars. The class midterm can be tough if you don't take the readings seriously seriously. Just stay on top of the readings and contribute in class and you'll be fine",

He teaches neutrally, exposing students to different perspectives while unbiasedly helping them to strengthen their own arguments. I highly recommend taking a course with him.",

He embodies the classic \"push you beyond your comfort zone/ introduce intentionally controversial ideas\" professor. I didn't always agree with him, but I honestly learned a lot.", 
            "Professor Salsman is by far one of the best professors I have had at Duke. Coming to academia from his previous job in finance, Salsman brings a unique real world knowledge to the table that most professors do not have and it is very clear that he teaches because he loves to teach. Lastly, if you like a great discussion, I highly recommend Salsman.", 
            "Salsman really engages the class with discussion during lecture. Topics covered in class are very interesting, but there is a lot of reading. Class participation definitely helps your grade. Had both a final exam and a final paper, though.", 
            "Professor Salsman is such a great professor! Always available outside of class at the local cafe for paper topics or just general advice. He really encourages debate and dialogue in class and loves to see participation. Will definitely take a class with him again.",

Lectures are boring, but still informative. However, he lacks a degree of empathy. Expects students to find coursework easy because he finds it to be so. Can be dismissive of student questions.",

Hes more helpful one on one, but thats not saying much, especially since he held office hours for two different courses at the same time.

            "Really not a good lecturer at all, and no textbook and unclear slides make it worse. Its as if someone handed him the slides five minutes before class and said heres what youre teaching. Its not a good course if you have to rely on TAs and office hours just to do the assignments and to learn anything. Would avoid at all costs",

It's too bad that the papers are graded harshly and it doesn't matter if you do the readings because all that matters are papers and the TAs can't tell who reads from who does not.

Much easier if you do the readings!",

One of the most knowledgeable about his field I've ever had, and really open and accessible to students. Short papers are graded leniently, term papers pretty strictly, but he really cares that you develop as a writer. Best class I've taken at Duke!",

He manages expectations clearly for a 300+ Compsci 201 class, and takes time out of his schedule to help during helper hours/after class. Great professor, and learned a lot.",

He pushes them, but not beyond their limits and is very accommodating in terms of deadlines. 201 has a lot of homework, but he provided guidance and there were a lot of Helper Hours run by the TAs, so that it was doable. I truly enjoyed the class and learned a lot! Would really recommend!", 
            "He is demanding but fair, and will always do whatever he can to help his many struggling students. His class reminds me of Bill Nye trying to explain global warming to the climate change deniers- A smart guy really trying hard not to lose his patience with the idiots around him (us students). Also, he is dreamy like a unicorn and hot like a pepper!",

Workload is fairly heavy but you're given a lot of help to get through the assignments. Azhar always asks for feedback and is willing to push deadlines back. Put in some effort, and 201 is entirely doable",

Even though the workload can be heavy, he is very accommodating. The first professor that I have had to continuously ask for feedback on the class through the semester.", 
            "He isn't a great lecturer. He doesn't explain things clearly and instead gives vague analogies without giving a real definition of what he's talking about. He doesn't double check his powerpoint notes before lecturing from them so he realizes in the middle of lecture that he wrote the wrong explanation. Lectures need to be more organized.",

If you put in the time at the beginning to learn the solution process, you will do much better than if you try to memorize specific cases.",

Easy for people good at test-taking. Must watch lectures",

No extra credit, but they do drop the lowest postlab, quiz and prelab grades. They allow a \"data sheet\" in exams but it doesnt help much. I don't recommend the class but it's the only one. Good luck.",

The course is relevant to many things in society today, I recommend it. Nice Prof.",

The final exam covered some concepts I don't remember being discussed.", 
            "This class is not worth taking unless you want to take it for the GPA boost. The fact that the Economics department does not count this class toward the Econ major depicts lack of information the course covers. If you're truly interested in finance, take ECON370.",

She's an absolute sweetheart and would recommend getting to know her in office hours or outside class. Very inspirational. One of the Duke's hidden treasures.", 
            "Not a huge fan of the class, since it's not very grounded in theory/mathematics. The grading on assignments is very volatile, since there is almost no partial credit, even though I somehow ended up with a good grade in the end. I learned a bit, but not as much as I would have wanted to in this class. She is an interesting woman to say the least.",

Problem sets are your BEST friend. Also, try getting to know her outside of class.",

Problem sets are definitely the most useful part of the class.",

The class is designed for you to succeed if you put in the effort. Minna is always available and willing to listen about everything. Her lectures are way more interesting than the standard powerpoint", 
            "DO THE READINGS. Take notes on the readings. Space out during lecture portions if you must. Keep up in the textbook and get along with your team, and you should do fine on quizzes, exams, and team activities. That being said, I took the class a year ago, and I heard that Ng has made it more difficult since.", 
            "I found the exams very challenging and initially struggled on the weekly quizzes. But she is very willing to help and after talking with her my quiz performance really improved. The flipped style and team activities allowed for more in-depth, engaging classes which were enhanced by her humor and savagery! Prof Ng sparked my interest in neuro.", 
            "The class solely relies on reading textbooks. Her lectures are super boring and make people log on Facebook. Tests are fulled of strange trick questions that make no sense according to the readings. And she defends her answers that is apparently wrong even if related articles are given. just take neuro 101", 
            "Prof. Ng is such an amazing professor and person! She's sarcastic and funny, which makes lectures much more interesting. The team-based learning style of the class also really helped me grasp the material better than a normal lecture would have. I highly recommend Prof. Ng and this class.",

            "Did NOT enjoy this class. Literally all the content comes from the textbook so class is completely useless, except for the tiniest, most random details that she put on the midterm. The in-class activities contribute nothing and class ended with a final and a 5-8 page paper (for a class with NO previous writing assignments) due on the same day.", 
            "Prof. Ng is the worst professor I have ever encountered. Her quizzes always have mistakes and were unnecessarily difficult. Midterm was impossible. She becomes defensive over her questions even when she is CLEARLY incorrect. Lectures do not help for her tests. Attendance is mandatory and if you do not show up, you get a 0 for the day, NO EXCUSES!",

Lectures are boring and restate everything from the reading, the quizzes have mistakes in them almost every week she is unaccommodating of students, and her tests are way harder than expected. Can be quite aloof, super strict. Avoid as much as possible.",

Zero problems with Ng, but there are downsides to the class itself: mandatory attendance, lots of quizzes, and it's easy to space during lectures. However, if you read the textbook carefully and take meticulous notes, you should do fine on quizzes and exams.", 
            "Prof. Ng was personable but could turn aloof and defensive when questioned. The questions on the weekly quizzes (which were allegedly crafted for hours) had frequent mistakes, and nary a week went by without questions being tossed out due to ambiguity. The team-based format can be frustrating if only some team members come to class fully prepared.",

Purely memorization with absolutely no critical thinking required. By memorization I mean specific sentences in the text. Everyone can memorize so everyone could pass, it's all a matter of your social life.",

Nobody is an expert on the material, and if students are supposed to teach each other, you can bet they are not doing a good (or correct) job. You will memorize the textbook and then pretend to pass off as an expert on the material as you engage in mindless debates that are most likely factually wrong.", 
            "Okay, so the teacher doesn't teach. And team-based is supposed to mean that you are split into a group of five other students and help each other learn. This sounds like a recipe for disaster, with people telling other people wrong information or misconceptions that they have concerning the material. You won't learn. You will memorize the textbook.", 
            "Do not take Neuroscience 102! Take 101. The \"team-based\" learning is an absolute farce and just an excuse for the teacher, who doesn't know the material, to not teach. Instead, the students are supposed to teach each other, even though everyone is in the same boat. Doesn't make sense, now does it? Essentially, you will have to memorize the textbook", 
            "The teacher is incredibly rude and not accessible. She will actively call people out in front of the entire class and she says a lot of uncomfortable things. Also, the quizzes she administers are filled with errors and she really doesn't know that much about neuroscience.",

Rosenberg is a utilitarian, but won't entertain any other points of views other than his own, despite claiming to value diversity of thought. His personality is based on eye roll inducing hot takes.",

Basically, if you listen to the phrases Rosenberg repeats during lecture and spit them on on the writing assignments you'll do well. Assignments are all short essays. Not a hard class, but very interesting.", 
            "He's a cool guy. His lectures are disorganized and hard to take notes on. We had 4 assignments the whole semester that were 2 essays each but they weren't hard at all. Take notes on what you can. Grades the essays super easy. If you do bad, you rewrite.", 
            "He is a smart guy, but needs to understand that he doesn't know everything. Was lecturing on inaccurate information at times, and doubled down on his false claims when a student called him out for it. The class itself was pointless. I will never use any of the knowledge I learned in the PPE gateway class ever again.", 
            "Good class experience. You can tell he knows a lot about what he is talking about. Lectures are very informative and done without any accompanying slides. You should take ur notes on a laptop with him (easier to keep up). Pay attention in class and at least do some of the reading and you will be fine. Papers are of good length with clear prompts.", 
            "One of the worst professors I've ever had. Very biased, little interested in learning student names, hard to follow lectures because his handwriting is illegible. He wants very specific answers to his questions and takes points off arbitrarily. Avoid if possible.", 
            "Great professor. Interesting and very intellectual person. Gives great lectures; you may forget to take notes because you are listening to him speak. He is a fast speaker, so get ready to write fast.", 
            "Definitely a little too keen on showing off his wikipedia-esque knowledge on basically everything. Lectures are fantastic when he has a solid grasp on the material, but are quite painful when he doesn't. Also somewhat dogmatic (tries to deny it), but that comes with the profession I guess. A well designed course; not bad overall.", 
            "Brilliant professor, I highly recommend everyone takes a class with him. The long readings (though he doesn't checks if anyone does it) will help you get the most out of lectures. He really requires students to be on their game if they ask questions/participate, and is amazing at getting debates and discussion going. One of the best lecturers here.", 
            "He's a very knowledgeable and interesting guy, and the class is really interesting. Just four reasonably short essays throughout the whole semester, along with short readings before most classes.", 
            "Professor Rosenberg is one of the brightest minds at Duke, and pushes his students to also be the brightest they can be. I am awestruck by his intellect. He sets high expectations and really challenges you; but you'll come out of the course gaining a skill for critical thinking you may never have had before. HIGHLY recommended.",

He is EXTREMELY liberal and lets everyone know, which isn't really philosophically relevant and can actually be super annoying, but overall he's a pretty great guy.",

What he teaches is amazing. Take this class. Only problem is that his comments on paper can be illegible at times...ask TA for clarification!",

To my surprise, we didn't get much readings throughout the semester, an average of 5-10 pages per week. Also, Prof and TAs were accessible and really helpful after class. Strongly recommend this class.",

I also liked the wide variety of readings he collected for each segment of the course. Really didn't get to know him personally though. Highly recommended nonetheless.",

Really tries to answer everyone's questions or stay after to answer them. No exams, just HW and quizzes. Wording can be confusing but just clarify at office hours and you'll be fine.",

            "Discussion sessions were very helpful in understanding the exam/lecture material. A wonderful lecturer (his humor transcended the students' interest in physiology). His exams are hard but you'll do fine if you understand the lecture material (they do not test rudimentary memorization, but comprehension) and do the problem sets.", 
            "Class itself is very intersting, but not the guest lecture except 1. If you study his problem set and review the lecture front and back, it is doable to get an A without touching the book once. Granted, you have to write well in the lab, which I didn't, and it take way too much time. Take this class if u have time and want to challenge yourself.", 
            "i agree that the book is useless for 151, his lectures and study questions are the most important. going to class is absolutely necessary, and he's kind of a jerk to you if you miss class. office hours are also very helpful; i think he makes his tests the night before and he'll often include topics that were discussed during his office hours", 
            "Very knowledgeable. However, gets sidetracked sometimes. Never really finished a lecture because he'd talk a lot about the material. Focused a lot on the biochem/small detail stuff. Tests were a bit difficult (average around 75) with a mixture of multiple choice and short answer. Do the practice problems! The book is useless.",

Lectures are somehow kept interesting, despite it being math. Would highly recommend.",

            "Blake is an amazing professor. I had him for calc 1 and 2. He's clear and will really help you understand. His tests are really hard though and hes a stickler on time and I couldn't ever fully finish his tests. But hes a great math 111 and 112 professor", 
            "He is probably the best professor I've had at Duke so far. Super clear, very helpful, and really makes an attempt to make sure you get the material. Intro calculus is going to be difficult no matter who is teaching it but he makes it absolutely manageable.", 
            "Professor Blake is extremely kind and makes calc as bearable as possible. He's always willing to help or re-explain material. I understood concepts I hadn't after sitting through a year of HS calc. The tests are hard, but there's no way around that. I've never liked math, but Prof. Blake is excellent; take calc with him if you can!", 
            "Probably failed his course. But wasn't his fault. He didn't even get to write the final. Super nice guy. Amazing professor. Highly recommend taking his class for 112. Definitely tough on the grading. But if you actually put the work in and really study hard for the midterms, you'll be fine. Do the prob sets and don't sleep on those labs either.", 
            "Blake is a phenomenal professor. he is extremely helpful and truly loves teaching. Math111 and 112 are not easy classes, but Blake makes them bearable and doable. Tests aren't awful - on par with any college Calculus course.", 
            "Professor Blake is the most awesome math professor you'll ever meet. His ability to explain fundamental concepts into things you can understand is just incredible. He will prepare you very well for the because his tests are very conceptual - which is what the final will be like. (I took 111 and 112 with him, and wish he taught other math classes)", 
            "Blake was an incredible teacher! Incredibly clear and cared about his students. Within the first couple weeks he knew all our names and if someone had any issues he was more than happy to break it down. Tests were hard but if put in effort in class and with homework you should be fine", 
            "Blake is definitely the best teacher for Math 111 (old # 31). Willing to help you if you put in the work, and he does a good job in class of explaining how he wants you to answer specific types of problems. Would be very difficult if you had never taken calc, but if you have to take 111, take it with Blake. (He gave out candy during the final!)", 
            "I had him for 31L and 32L. He is extremely clear in lectures, and an overall excellent teacher that kept me engaged. This class is brutally hard because of the curve, though I felt like I definitely improved my math skills a lot (C+ in 31L and B+ in 32L) but the fact remains that this class is a GPA killer no matter what teacher you have."

            "Good class, chill professor. Attendance is important. Lectures are amazing", 
            "Very refined orator and clear lecturer. I am a little underwhelmed by the discussion portions in lectures (which are very little). But fairly speaking, it's hard enough to teach a 100-people philosophy class, and sometimes having discussions only makes things worse. Otherwise he is great.", 
            "Amazing lectures. Reading is light, but crucial to doing well. Papers graded fairly. It's advantageous to cite the readings as much as possible in the papers. Grading 100% up to TA, but my TA was fantastic. Inordinately critical of religion, which he knows nothing about (e.g. he thought Moses was Jesus' father lol). Brilliant in area of expertise.", 
            "Anomaly is def. one of the best profs at Carolina. lectures are super interesting and so is the material. Reading load is not ridiculously heavy. Anomaly tolerates and encourages diff. viewpoints and is logically coherent. Only semi-annoying thing is he will criticize religion almost every chance he gets when the class has nothing to do with it.", 
            "TAKE THIS CLASS!! Anomaly is a super engaging professor and his class is amazing. Super personable, awesome to work with in and out of class. 100% recommend. Definitely do the readings so that you can come to class and engage in the conversations. Your grade is made up of 3 take home exams with a random quiz and participation included.",

Big sister recommended this prof, and I heard about his PPE class from my best friend. Didn't think it would be this good.", 
            "I LOVED this class. If there's one professor you have to take at Carolina, it's Anomaly. He's a solid speaker, encourages discussion, respects different viewpoints, and is really fun to talk to outside of class.", 
            "Dr. Anomaly is far and away one of the best teachers I've had so far. Though some of the readings are pretty dense, his lectures are very clear and the examples he provides in them are crucial for understanding. Office hours are also extremely helpful, and, as if it didn't get better, the tests are all take home!", 
            "only bad thing is half of the class takes place at Duke.", 
            "Epic class, great professor", 
            "Anomaly is a solid professor, though the class could've been organized better. He engages with students in and out of class about the material and is an interesting lecturer. He also loves what he studies, and his enthusiasm is contagious. His only shortcoming is that he treats religion as being petty mysticism, which is intellectually dishonest.", 
            "Phenomenal professor.", 
            "Fantastic professor. He is humorous, insightful, and thought provoking. Grading is up to the TA who can be inept at times. All in all, not too hard of a class and very,very enlightening. Definitely recommend both him and the PPE gateway class.", 
            "great teacher. if you do the readings and use them in your tests or take-home essays, you will do well. he's very available for questions and will help during office hours if you're confused. awesome philosophy professor. this class changes how you look at the world. he is a strict grader but again if you pay attention in class you'll be fine.", 
            "Best Econ class I took all year. The concepts were simple, but the applications were fascinating and the professor was really good.",

Very friendly and knowledgable about economics and art history. Chances are if you are interested in arts, you'll enjoy this course. His expectations are usually clear and reasonable",

            "This course, \"The History of Art Markets,\" was also crosslisted in ARTHIST and VMS. Be sure to never miss class and to participate even if you don't know much at first. He is very kind; very knowledgeable; very respected. Definitely recommend the course to econ majors looking to learn a practical application.",

            "Hans was a great professor. I learned a lot from his intro to art history 102 class, and enjoyed it a lot. However, the final exam was unbelievably difficult and far too specific. It was inconsistent with class lectures as well as the Janson book.", 
            "Incredible lecturer! Funny and so interesting. This class requires a TON of studying (mostly pure memorization) but grades are fair.", 
            "HARD, because of an intense amount of memorization. GO TO CLASS.",

His lectures are entertaining albeit change course all the time based on questions. His passion for learning is obvious so if you can bring something new to the table you will be rewarded for it.", 
            "Although this class has cultured me, the obscene amount of time it takes me to study for the ludicrous quizzes has hurt my GPA in other areas. Hans is a pretty cool guy who loves Art and makes lectures really entertaining, but it's easy not to like this guy when your grade sucks. DO NOT TAKE IF YOU WANT AN EASY, FUN CLASS.", 
            "Interesting lecturer. However, you have to memorize a ridiculous amount of paintings. I, personally, am horrible at memorizing massive amounts of facts. For the final, you're responsible for everything in the book and all of the lectures. There is one paper and the expectations are terribly unclear.", 
            "One of the best, most interesting professors I've ever had! In most classes, lectures make me fall asleep, but he is so passionate about the subject and is so well versed in it that it makes you WANT to listen. I love his lectures and am very, very happy I chose to take this class!", 
            "THE BEST PROFESSOR AT DUKE. He's such a wonderful and entertaining lecturer -- you can tell he's absolutely passionate about the material. Not good if you're super anal about grades and need clear guidelines as to how grades are calculated. But if you love to learn and enjoy your lectures, Van Miegroet is a MUST!", 
            "While not clear (at all) about his expectations, his lectures were interesting. He definitely knows what he's talking about, and if you're at all interested in art, you'll learn a lot. The final is a breeze, but it's tough to know how you're going to do because everything is so disorganized.",

Loved the final paper Cons: class expectations totally incomprehensible. Practically failed the exam but aced the paper. Very difficult to follow what is important in homework-", 
            "By FAR my least favorite professor at Duke (and thus class). He isn't funny, and even if he was, you couldn't understand his jokes b/c his accent is so thick. As a non-major, I was interested in taking this class for general knowledge-HUGE mistake! The workload is ridiculous and not shown in the grading. AVOID unless you dream of being a curator.", 
            "What a terrible class! He's only mildly funny (he uses the same joke 900 times) and nobody EVER knew what he expected from us. He seemed more concerned with proving to us that Art History wasn't easy than actually teaching us anything important. Avoid like the plague. Only people who are easily impressed/amused will like him."

Midterms were generally easy, however, with a median of almost 90%",

The course is masterfully structured, and gives you an excellent overview of the field. Definitely one of the best taught classes at Duke.", 
            "Edna is the best. Gender and Language was my favorite class because of her. You learn a bit about research methodology. Lectures were interesting, decent amount of work (readings, papers), easy grader (show interest and effort). Great class discussion and fun to participate in. Best, sweetest, most delightful professor I've had at Duke. 10/10", 
            "Edna is the most incredible professor ever. Of course, her class isn't easy and there's readings due every week. But it's totally worth it. She's kind, easy grader, and she genuinely cares about her students. Even after Focus ended she still makes time to grab dinner with us. Highly recommend - she's a huge part of what made freshman year awesome.", 
            "Edna is extremely knowledgeable about the intersection of linguistics and neuroscience, and she will definitely change what you think you know about both subject areas. She truly does care about every member of the class, and would even come to our dorm before tests and go over any questions we had. Amazing professor. Read and you'll do well.", 
            "Edna was the \"college mother\" of our first semester. She really wants you to get something out of the focus program and her course. Encourages participation and homeworkreadings are a must. But her worldview is inspiring. Research is her passion but obviously so is the classroom. Course will be missed next semester.", 
            "Dr. Andrews is a great person, and her lectures really help you get the most out of the readings. The material itself lacks depth, since it attempts to cover both neuroscience and linguistics to students of very different backgrounds. Her exams, homework, and grading are all very clear and fair, so if you pay attention in class, you'll be fine.", 
            "Edna is the most amazing professor I've ever had. Every lecture is interesting, she's always there to help, she's a super easy grader, and you actually learn something.", 
            "Edna is incredible. There was a lot of reading but I learned so much and everyone in my class got an A. She helped us beyond the classroom and truly cares about her students.", 
            "Professor Andrews is one of the most generally nice people (let alone professors) you will ever meet. She is incredibly knowledgeable in linguistics, neuroscience, and studies concerning sex differences, but is still very approachable. Always gives students the benefit of the doubt and always enjoys lively class discussions.", 
            "I learned so much from Dr. Andrews. She is always willing to help, and is one of the most intelligent and impressive people you will ever meet. There was no textbook for this class, but you had to read to readings very closely and know them very well.", 
            "Fantastic teacher, excellent at explaining both theoretical and practical uses for everything we learned in class.", 
            "Edna is fantastic and easily my favorite professor at Duke. You get to pick which questions you answer on the tests and readings don't take long. Take a class with her!!"

            "Exams test on what is covered in the lectures. He is a clear lecturer and a great professor. He made a very conceptually difficult class achievable.", 
            "If you took AP Chem in high school, you will be fine. Otherwise, be prepared to be confused for the duration of the lectures and learn next to nothing.", 
            "Dr. Roy is a very good professor. He's fair and cares about his students; the tests are challenging but reasonable. The only frustrating thing about the class is that the discussion TAs play a great role in your understanding, so if you end up with a bad TA it can really impact your experience in the class.", 
            "If you do poorly on the 3 exams/finals, you will fail this class. That being said, just study for the exams and you should be fine. The exam questions are fairly straight forward from lecture and discussion questions. Lectures are dull, but go to get notes. The textbook is totally useless.", 
            "Professor Roy is a really charismatic and knowledgable lecturer. While he could be a little condescending at times, he genuinely tried to help students succeed. He gave very fair midterms that tested understanding of the material and would even clarify things during exams to help you do your best.", 
            "Going to class is not mandatory or needed - unless you feel like you learn better in the lecture setting, you will not be left behind if you read the textbook yourself because that's pretty much what he does in lecture. Nothing especially hard, just chem101, study the material and you will do well. If not, it will be tough.", 
            "I mostly skipped lecture and just relied on AP Chem knowledge plus the textbook/exercises, but when I was in class he was clearly quite the public speaker--he went a bit too slow sometimes in my opinion, but otherwise is definitely a really knowledgeable and generally friendly guy. There are times when he loses his patience, but rare.", 
            "He is a very engaging lecturer and easy-going. I got to know him during my time at the Marine-lab and since then all the feedback I've heard from friends taking his class was that \"He made chem so much easier than I thought.\" I took his CHEM101 this semester (not finished) but he is definitely an approachable, engaging, and devoted lecturer.", 
            "I really don't understand why they have us copying 3 pages of 1.25 spaced procedures into a lab notebook by hand before every lab. This is unnecessary, childish, and tedious, not to mention a complete waste of time and effort. This class is good, but lab really, really sucks.", 
            "Dr. Roy is great. Very enthusiastic lecturer and very well put-together. The material can be dense, but he does a great job explaining it and his lectures are very organized. Very accessible outside of class. My only regret is that I can't take Orgo with him", 
            "Absolutely amazing. His lectures are enjoyable and interesting. I really think this man deserves a reward for how great he is. Highly Highly Highly recommend taking his class.", 
            "I really disliked his style of lecturing. He often went off topic and did not focus on the material that we were tested on. His tests were extremely difficult and the wording was sometimes confusing.", 
            "I had Roy for the first half of CHEM101 and Macphail for the second half. Roy is definitely more clear with his language. He's very available outside of class, and offers study sessions before midterms. I'd recommend reading the textbook chapters for this class because it makes things more clear. Definitely take the labs and discussions seriously.", 
            "Dr. Roy is a great lecturer; he uses his projected iPad screen for lecture so it's easy to take notes, and he keeps lectures interesting and funny. I highly recommend him, but you still have to study and read the textbook if you want to be proficient in chemistry.", 
            "His humor is meh. Kind of gets in the way of lectures, and he only explains concepts and topics at the surface level. This class is just fine if you had a solid AP Chem. teacher. If you do not have an AP Chem background, find students to help you because Roy and MacPhail's lectures will not adequately prepare you for exams. Textbook is great-use it", 
            "I enjoyed Roy's lectures - his jokes helped lessen the dryness of the material, and he explained concepts clearly. He was enthusiastic and made chemistry about as palatable as it could be. The lectures followed the textbook pretty closely. His exams are fair assessments of your understanding, and he'll give you points back on a regrade if deserved.", 
            "Roy is very engaging during his lectures and tries to make chemistry as interesting as possible. If you skip lectures, definitely read the textbook. Roy has a cute dog too.", 
            "Dr. Roy is an enthusiastic lecturer whose energy can lead you through a content heavy class. Even so, all the information comes rapid-fire fast. Even during office hours, his responses can come far faster than your questions. A very cool man who's flunched often, but he moves quickly.", 
            "Great guy, very engaging and enthusiastic.", 
            "Though I hadn't taken chemistry since 10th grade, this class was not very difficult. Since the lecture notes are posted online and the textbook is fantastic (uses clear, basic language and easily explains tough concepts) attending lecture isn't necessary (though Roy is great). Labs and online HWs are annoying and can take up a good amount of time."

If the kids who take this class weren't insufferable enough, Robert is a playground bully who talks down to anyone who dares ask him such pedestrian questions. This class makes ECE/CS not worth it", 
            "Be prepared to sacrifice every other part of your life for this class at certain points of the semester. High workload, but if you're interested in software the assignments will be fun and you'll learn a lot just by looking things up and researching problems you run into while coding (arguably more than you learn in lecture), but grading is vague.", 
            "Funny how everyone complains that Duvall isn't good at lecturing/doesn't teach the right stuff when 85% of y'all are on Facebook the entire time in class. 290 and 308 mirror real-life software engineering -- if you think a real SWE job will be holding your hand through lectures instead of learning by doing and research, I have bad news for you.", 
            "Extremely unorganized professor. Expect him to release assignments late and then claim he released it days before and reject any of the students' attempts to ask for an extension. Also expect massively unclear grading criterions. Finally, he discourages people to contribute to class discussions by putting people down sarcastically for that.", 
            "Easy class if you already know some webdev and need to boost gpa + can pick up a new framework. Duvall is awful tho. Every single lecture/lab is from the documentation of that weeks language/framework as if hes learning them for the first time too (he might be). Never explains any theory, just the basics of implementation (off the tutorials).", 
            "Duvall is a terrible lecturer (very boring, lecture topics rarely relate to class work), and his systems of TA feedback are pretty poor. However, I did really enjoy how detailed and well-thought-out his assignments were, and he was very accessible and helpful in office hours. If you don't expect a typical lecturing professor, you might enjoy him.", 
            "Feedback was utterly nonexistent. Of the maybe 20 assignments/labs in the course, we got feedback on no more than 4, and he would actively ignore requests for feedback on Piazza. Then, final grades were a full week late. He seems like a nice enough guy, but his organization is inexcusable.", 
            "Lectures are useless and not worth attending. Having TA meetings are key to passing this class. The assignments take forever but I learned a lot from just doing them.", 
            "Prof. Duvall is of the \"learn through the struggle\" school of computer science teaching. However, he is aware of this, and tries to help you with that struggle. Not an easy professor, but you will learn practical skills from him if you work for it. Labs are not graded for correctness so you can play around with the technologies to learn them well.", 
            "If I could, I would give him a 0/5. Horrible class. You're expected to learn everything by your own in your own time. If you really want to learn web dev, you might as well learn by yourself because Duvall sure won't teach you. Oh, and half of the TAs also don't know how to do most of the projects. One week per project + unclear grading criteria.", 
            "Very Hard Class. TONS OF WORK. :(", 
            "Duvall clearly knows the course material and has lots of good insights into software design, but his lectures are really dry and he tends to ramble some. The projects are a lot of work, but are good projects to teach basic design. Considering this is the one of the few programming classes in the department, it should be a requirement for the degree", 
            "Software design and maintainability is extremely important- however Duvall does a terrible job teaching more advanced design concepts, although the readings are pretty good. The amount that you learn is not worth the effort you put in- most people who say this is a good class are bad at coding. Don't take this class.", 
            "Software design is important, but Duvall teaches nothing about it in lecture. The projects are a ton of work, but they are just boring and tedious. Don't take this class for the \"practical experience\". No employer will care about your JavaFX applications. If you are signed up for 308, drop it and take a more important class like 310 or 330.", 
            "Duvall is smart and you will learn an amazing amount. It is a time commitment and it's hard to get feedback, but what do you expect when you're trying to learn software? Also, everyone complaining about this class ended up with a A- or A. so quit complaining.", 
            "CS308 is a highly valuable class for any future software developer, and Duvall deserves credit for the projects he assigns. Completing the coursework of 308 makes you feel ready to take on the world. Other than that, Duvall is an awful professor. No feedback, lectures aren't helpful, and he just doesn't seem to care.",

He was hilarious and genuinely tried to make the material somewhat interesting for students who may not enjoy science. It is extremely important to write down nearly everything he says so attending class is pretty important. Almost no homework!", 
            "Professor Glass is a good lecturer and seems like a great guy, but the tests are SO hard and worth 90% of your grade. They're based mostly on lectures, which aren't recorded, slides aren't very helpful, and he talks fast so it's hard to write everything down. I thought it'd be an easy NS, but I'm not even going to end up with a B ://", 
            "I wasn't a big fan of his lectures, but Professor Glass was my friend's favorite professor. Easy material, but take the class seriously. Grade based on 3 midterms and a 7-page book report. Other than book report, barely any homework is assigned. Not particularly interesting class, though, so wouldn't recommend taking it just for the NS credit.", 
            "he is obviously very passionate about what he is teaching and tries to make boring lectures more interesting, however, this class is extremely difficult. The test questions are all extremely specific and you must write down everything he says during class. Would not recommend taking it if you want an easy A, even a B is hard to attain.", 
            "Course structure makes succeeding on exams (the vast majority of your grade) a challenge. There is minimal context on his presentations and he does not record his lectures which makes studying almost solely based on your notes. Questions asked are absurdly random and specific. The exams feel like a guessing game. Good lecturer, awful course.", 
            "This class is definitely not easy as people say it is. He speaks extremely quickly which does not allow you to write down everything he says. His exams test you on the most insignificant parts of his lectures. I would not recommend taking this course.",

            "He was a good lecturer and the class had some interesting parts, but some parts were boring because they were too specific. His slides didn't have much information so you have to go to class and pay attention. Average grade was a B. Negatives were him missing some classes and he said he would post grades that night but then posted a week later.",

This course is rather straightforward if you take it seriously. Glass is rather interesting about 70% of the time but the other 30% can be hard to stay awake.",
