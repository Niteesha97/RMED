She is clearly passionate about chemistry, but has some time management issues, which makes it hard for her to explain things in an appropriate manner. She tries to be helpful and accessable but kind of fails. =/ Really nice though! However, I doubt I'd recommend her.",

Not only i wasnt allowed to retake the quiz at a later time, but i was asked to complete as much as i can and submit with everyone else. I solved all but one problem and had points deducted for that one missing answer. A police report from my accident was of no use! Tough lady! heh",

Read the book, do the hw, go to class, take notes and it is easy to get an A. Don't expect any pity from her if you don't attend class regularly or don't do the hw. She is totally complacent about her student's progress in the class.", 
            "Hey, she might be snarky (seriously -- why mock people's grades? That's cold, Miss Lady) but she's smart, clear, and pedagogically sound. It's challenging, but you're taking this 'cause you want to go to med/dent/some other All-Growed-Up school. So suck it up, study hard, and you'll be well prepared by Doc Ott.",

Provides weekly lectures and if you follow them and take good notes, you'll do good. No surprises - final was similar to homework. Advice on final: speed is essential. Work fast or you won't finish in time.",

When I called him, he said that on the Final he \"awarded 1/3 of the class a 100%, 1/3 a 75% and 1/3 a 50%.\" He threatened six of us with an F if we reported him to the administration.",

You get a lesson with him about every 5 weeks and sometimes he seems more interested in sending texts on his phone than teaching. Studio class can be variable. Inspiring one week, distracted the next.",

I had more lessons in 1 semester in my undergrad than in 2 years NU"
