In private, she'll make comments that cut deeply. Beware.",

I'm not sure if it's more me or him, but half my notes were funny things that he says; his lectures are extremely engaging and really give you a taste of the art in math.",

His tests can be rough, and can be substantially more difficult than the practice tests/study guides, but if you do the homework problems, and the extra practice problems, you should be fine, as long as you really have them down. If you skip even one class, it can really set you back.",

Very abrupt and short when asked for help during office hours. Not empathetic when you came with questions that he felt you \"should\" have known the answers. One of the worst professors during my 4y at Penn.",

Luckily I ignored him and am applying to match in vascular surgery this spring. If you're doubting yourself because of things he said to you- know it's not you- it's him.", 
            "Winkler can teach well enough, however on a personal level, he is demeaning, condescending, and makes efforts to shame students rather than help us. I love chemistry but he turns me away from it. He makes going to class or meeting with him a very unpleasant experience.",

Refreshing and engaging readings.",

Dr. Lexow was present in all the stress and internal struggles I battled at the time, and supported me with passion, understanding, guidance, and maternal care.",

Lots of reading/understanding of primary literature articles is required, and grades are determined based on presentation of deep analytical abilities with these materials. However, her classes are very rewarding - giving essential skills for the practice of medicine.",

Most classes will then explore every aspect of that topic through class discussion. It is therefore imperative to thoroughly and critically evaluate all reading materials provided. You will literally be at the edge of science!", 
            "There is a reason why Dr. Lexow's classes have long wait lists each year. Her class taught me a range of skills that will be essential to me as I aspire to become an informed biomedical professional. I learned to comprehend and synthesize scientific literature with ease. There is a lot of work required each week, but it is highly rewarding.", 
            "Dr. Lexow is one of the best professors at Penn. Her classes require a strong background in neuroscience and she pushes her students to think critically about research and the current state of the field. Dr. Lexow gives great feedback and genuinely cares about her students. Id encourage anyone looking for a rewarding challenge to take her classes.",

As I begin my career as a med student next fall, I am grateful that she taught me valuable skills that will help me succeed in the future.",

            "Ditty brings an upbeat mood to class. His lectures are entertaining, helping students stay engaged. With little effort, Ditty comes up with many great examples of each concept we cover; he's very knowledgeable. He is also approachable, welcoming any and all questions students may have. To me, he is one of the best professors at SP2.", 
            "Professor Ditty is extremely knowledgeable when it comes to the subject of this course: DBT. There was a lot of information packed into this semester course, and I completed the course confidently knowing that I learned a great deal---specifically due to having such a dedicated, genuine, and deeply knowledgeable prof. Highly recommend Prof. Ditty!", 
            "Prof. Ditty is a fantastic teacher! He has a very successful DBT practice in Delaware and is brings in a lot of direct clinical research with him. I think he combines the research and practical experience (concrete software to use and when) to inform future practitioners. Very recommended but you gotta like research!", 
            "Ditty is a pretty cool guy. He talks about DBT a lot because that is what he works with. We do mindfulness exercise at the beginning of every class. He lectures the whole time, even if he runs out of things to do he makes us sit there. Very rarely do we ever get out early and by early I mean at least 5 mins. He's funny though and very honest.", 
            "nice", 
            "Professor Ditty is single-handedly improving my perspective on research. He makes it fun, relevant, and links our learning to subjects we care about. The class is difficult, but he supports us and constantly expresses encouragement. Matthew Ditty is a great professor, one of the best I've taken, and a human being I respect a hell of a lot.", 
            "Really boring and arrogant", 
            "Matt is such a great professor. I found the material of the class to be rather dry, but it was still my favorite class to attend every week. He typically bring in his own real world experience to help bridge the material to your practice. He is very willing to help students. Don't take the class if you don't want to be challenged!", 
            "He is awesome. Very helpful and makes class interesting an fun. He brought his dog into class to prove a point about a theory. Definitely recommend taking him!", 
            "Very great professor. He will work with you as long as you are willing to work.", 
            "I loved Ditty's quirkiness and the fact that he really cares about his students. He does tend to be a little sensitive, especially if you challenge him, but he's also very approachable. He's funny and is open to talk with students outside of class. Definitely recommend taking him.", 
            "Good classroom environment, supportive teacher who wants students to understand assignments, open to feedback from students, wants students to do well and be passionate about swrk."

Top 3: her love of her subject is infectious, she chooses interesting stuff to cover in every lecture so it's never boring, and she's very funny. It's a class I always want to go to and makes me want to take another anthro class, preferably with her.",

Course is all over the place, syllabus is vague, and tangents take up most of the class time. If you like the material (human evolution, fossils, primates), you might enjoy and learn something in the course, despite her scattered teaching style.",

She's a fantastic educator and is always taking part in great educational experiences outside of class (volunteer projects, lectures, etc.). She will be missed at the University of Pennsylvania and will be a great asset to another institution.",

I'm sure she is brilliant but she can't teaach and at the end of the day you don't feel any more knowledgable in the topic. Easy A if you don't mind that you didn't learn a thing.", 
            "HILARIOUS, brilliant, sweet professor. She knows her stuff, loves to help, and makes class interesting. True, she went on tangents all of the time, but we learned a lot.", 
            "Personally, she's kind and funny. However, her lectures are far from helpful. People go to class because they wanna *learn stuff*. She digresses and talks about her life or how great anthropology is (as a field, not the class material) EVERYDAY. Entertaining at the year's start but when midterms come you wish she'd just teach one relevent class.", 
            "Very interesting lectures, amazingly animated professor.", 
            "Truly one of the better undergraduate professors we have in the department. Her classes are always lively and fun, interesting lesson plans, and exciting discussions. If you feel like stalling, just steer the conversation off topic. The readings can be put off until the midterm and final if need be, but should be done and reviewed as they're really neither too heavy nor too much.

I would have preferred something else in an intro class where people are learning the math ropes, but I bet he's fantastic in 240 or 241, for example. He can seem intimidating, but he's actually very friendly and helpful. (Even though he looks like a viking.)",

It was not diffucult to get the grade,however the course was quite intense, carried out in a short period of timeActually, the course was useless as the professor did not provide us with any knowledge-not only the presentation was not his, but also he just read the slides which we could do on our own at home",
