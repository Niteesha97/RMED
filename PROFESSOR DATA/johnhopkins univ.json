Exam expectations are very clear, and the curve is VERY generous. Would take this class again just for his teaching! Wish more profs were like him", 
            "Professor Lectka is an amazing orgo professor. He only teaches you what you need to know in a clear and concise manner. He always gives examples and problems in class that he goes over step by step. This is one of his main teaching methods so class attendance is highly encouraged. He is hilarious and made me want to go to class to learn.", 
            "Professor Lectka is an incredibly engaging professor, who guides the class through the course content in a clear and easy to follow progression. His teaching style and wit make the challenging concepts covered in Orgo 2 easy to digest. If you engage with the lectures and practice the concepts covered in class, you will be successful.", 
            "Prof. Lectka's class for Orgo 2 was delivered in a very refreshing style, and he emphasizes a lot on understanding concepts instead of purely memorizing. Highly recommended to take orgo with him!", 
            "Took the organic II class and it was absolutely amazing. Professor is incredibly clear and conveys the information in a very understandable, entertaining manner. Would absolutely recommend this class to anyone interested in taking organic ii. Tests are extremely fair and require you apply the information that you learned in class.", 
            "took his summer lab class. relaxed atmosphere, easy A, loved the banana oil experiment.", 
            "Working in the Lectka lab is very rewarding. You are able to get a lot of hands-on experience and work directly with grad students on their individual projects. Dr. Lectka is very open to having undergraduates join the lab and makes the effort to get to know everyone! Would recommend to anyone looking to do organic research", 
            "Dr. Lectka's course was amazing. While there is no textbook, and the material is more difficult, it was highly rewarding. His lectures make the material graspable, and the concepts you learn will apply to all fields of chemistry, and even made adv. biochemistry courses much easier (my peers who did not take this course did not feel same way).", 
            "His lectures were the best part of the course because he taught from actual scientific research papers instead of secondhand textbook info. He provided a real world perspective of organic chemistry, with his own personal brand of humor!", 
            "Best Orgo 2 Teacher EVER! Some say he is even better than Falzone", 
            "Really interesting dude. He combines earthy, working class science humor with an Ivy League polish. His jokes are not superfluous, and they all carry a deeper lesson. Pitches the material high and hard as it's an honors class. You will learn a lot of organic chemistry, and it will be up to date.", 
            "Great guy, nice professor. Knows everything about organic. You have to show up to class as notes are not posted. He uses chalk board rather than power point which is nice", 
            "Really excellent class, dynamic professor. He gave us papers to read and we got to do quantum calculations.", 
            "He teaches an outstanding organic synthesis class, very up to date. Punctuates his lectures with humorous discussion of academic feuds and egos. I loved it!", 
            "Had him for organic synthesis. Excellent and very knowledgable master of the subject.",

Exams are very different than other Hopkins exams, very memorization heavy, however, they aren't too difficult. Large percentage of the class ends with an A. Just an extremely fun class to take when you want to fill out your schedule.",

She is very understanding when it comes to grading and gives you as many points as possible on tests.", 
            "She's awful. Her exams are ridiculously hard. She isn't understanding at all and she teaches with an attitude. She makes you basically memorize the entire book. She assigns way too much and expects too much and she does little on her end. Everything I've learned was self-taught from the book. She also grades extremely harshly.", 
            "Pros - lots of points to be had in assignments which all are worth more than the test. Cons - you will read and LEARN ON YOUR OWN (basically buying yourself a 4,000 USD \"A\"), short and diagram-based lectures, lots of busy work that tries to make you thinks, quizzes are so specific and they can be tricky and short-timed. Tip: find a smart group.", 
            "Dr Safford's class was one of the best I had during my MS program at Johns Hopkins. She knows her subject well and puts it across in a simple and understandable manner. Plus she gives extr credit assignments. Easy to score a good grade if you do your bit sincerely."

            "While I think that Dr. Falzone has a very generous curve, I did not find his lectures helpful. The lectures were sometimes very hard to follow and he tends to go off topic and rush through the actual material. Be prepared to teach yourself using the textbook because Dr. Falzone tends to assume that you already know the information.", 
            "Going into Orgo as a freshman was terrifying, yet it's now my easiest class. Falzone's grading makes an 80 and A, and you'll likely do better than that. He drops 3/8 quizzes, replaces lowest midterm with final if that helps, gives extra credit and has tons of backtests. Your grade will be reflective of how well you understand orgo, with wiggle room", 
            "Took him for orgo I over the summer. Super fun guy and his lectures keep you engaged, but make sure to read the textbook for his exams and final. Honestly, he could keep up his happy quirkiness despite the class's dismal enthusiasm.", 
            "I had him for freshman ochem section. His tests are very doable and he gives you chances to improve your grade. Only annoying thing was his nearly weekly quizzes.", 
            "Falzone might not be the best lecturer, but his tests are FAIR. No unexpected twists or turns, if you read the textbook and work hard for class, you'll pass with an A! Your lowest midterm score is dropped, that made me go from a C to an A. Bless this man. He has a sense of humor and you really learn to love him.", 
            "Very personable guy and a good lecturer. He goes over everything you need to know - maybe not super clearly, but all slides are posted online. Office hours are great too, he really cares about the students and the class.", 
            "One of the best professors at Hopkins, really cares about his students.", 
            "Falzone teaches the freshman section of orgo. The tests were really fair and a majority of the class got an A. If you take this class, plan on doing PILOT too, since he collaborates with it.", 
            "Pretty friendly guy, but not a great lecturer. Especially when it comes to NMR- he speaks on a level that his students aren't yet equipped to understand. It's not hard to do well in the class if you work hard, however. His tests are consistent and he gives tons of practice. The course is pretty interesting too.", 
            "Great professor, always eager to answer students' questions. Occasionally cracks jokes. Interesting character.", 
            "First, Prof. Falzone is a great guy. He does want his students to be successful. You only need to get an 80 to get an A. He doesn't want hostile competition. Instead, he wants people to actually get the course material. However, on the other hand, he is not a clear lecturer. We had a substitute and most people think he is better at explaining.", 
            "He is a great lecturer and a great person in general. He knows the material well and makes it very clear what you need to know. He is also super accessible and if he knows you're genuinely trying, he will take a personal interest in your success.", 
            "Falzone is an amazing Professor who is ridiculously fair and an amazing lecturer, if you take orgo at hopkins, try to get him or Greenberg", 
            "Remember to write every reaction he puts on the board and understand them thoroughly. Office hours are essential. He notices when you try and will always be there for you. Don't take too many courses along with this class. Scores around the high 70s to 80s are usually in the A range. Try your best and you'll reap the reward.", 
            "Organic chemistry is a tough concept, there's no getting around it. That being said, Falzone's class emphasizes independent studying. Pre-read the material before lecture, or be prepared to sit through class not knowing what's going on. Falzone assumes you've read.", 
            "He obviously knows the material very well and has a very good grasp on it, however, he is not as good in transferring this knowledge to his students clearly. I found practicing and studying myself much helpful than lectures. He's really helpful and Office hours are VERY helpful. He uses clickers so attending class gives you a few additional points.", 
            "Intelligent guy. Thinks deep. Exams can be tough, typical average is between 60-70. His office hours help a lot and he has plenty of respurces in his website. It can be quite intimidating to ask questions, but he's a really nice guy who sincerely cares for his students.", 
            "Falzone is definitely a very smart individual, but he's not the best teacher. He flies through chapters of the textbook within minutes, and goes through examples very quickly. In fact, if you don't read the textbook before class, odds are you'll be behind. He's not the best at office hours either, and can be very condescending. I don't recommend.", 
            "Don't take his class. he is not a good lecturer at all. he tries to be funny but he's not. Take Klein over the summer", 
            "Falzone makes an effort to have everyone know what's going on. He understands that everyone wants to do well and adjusts his class accordingly. There are sometimes where he is a little confusing, but if you go in and ask questions when you just think you don't understand, then you'll be good."

It was online and he very clearly had NO idea how to use a computer, and had conflicting info everywhere. \"Lectures\" were basically him reading his outline, and surfing the FDA website.

            "While his class was very hard, I greatly appreciate how he cares for his students.", 
            "Great professor cares about your grade if you care", 
            "Torcaso is a great lecturer. And Math subjects are really hard to teach as lectures. But Torcaso can do it. He will make sure you understand the material. Took a class with him over the summer and he was fantastic. I don't see the negative comments below as being relateable in my experience. Lots of assignments, in class and homework - great prof!", 
            "At first I was thinking about dropping this course but I'm so happy that I did not drop it! The lectures are very helpful, make sure you take good notes. The handwritten notes by the professor are also good materials to study. Textbooks are okay but it's not mandatory to read them. The exams are very fair, not hard if you understand the lectures.", 
            "Some people say he's a nice guy, some people say he was rude, mean, and unnaproachable. I saw both sides. On the whole he didn't seem very interested in us. There was way too much homework for it to count for such a low percentage of the overall grade. The tests had wordy questions. ZERO partial credit. Felt like he was just trying to dock points.", 
            "I don't know why everyone said he cares about his students - he literally screamed at this one girl for no reason,and snorted dismissively while handing back tests to the students that apparently didn't do well. I came out with an okay understanding of stats and better understanding that there are rude people out there.", 
            "If you only expect to memorize formulas you won't do well. Tests are based more on understanding than memorization and are structured around examples given in class.

His lectures were always interesting and well organized and he was a funny guy, overall. Sections were helpful, and they always answered any questions from class. The papers and tests were very reasonable. Lectures were a must.",

Also TAs have influence on your final grade so kiss up",

He asks the class how they would like to do something to fit to everyones learning style.I love Larry",

            "Great teacher - his TA did all the grading. His tests aren't too bad. He's always full of energy even on his bad days and loves the topic. You learn everything through class discussions (which often times lead to him sharing interesting stories) but you find yourself understanding it. Pay attention he calls on people at random. Great guy.",

            "Best professor I ever had at Johns Hopkins. Offered me an internship because I was interested in what he did and then wrote me a letter of recommendation to law school. He was an awesome professor and everyone should take his Law & Psych class (which he also let me TA because I loved it so much). He is awesome.",

            "He's a very interesting guy, good lecturer, but the class was way too long (3 hrs). He was unclear about the class requirements until 3/4 of the way through the semester. The final also had questions addressing subject material he specifically said would not be on the exam. Basically, the class was frustrating but had it's good moments."

He is always there for extra help, and incredibly knowledgeable on the subject matter.",

The only good thing is that he gave back tests to review for exams.",

Also he would not grant me an extension when I had to miss a test to go to a funeral. Just not a good experience",

            "Prof. Klein teaches organic chemistry in a way that is tailored to help students learn by recognizing patterns rather than by rote memorization, and I have yet to have another professor who is as effective as he was. The assigned textbook turned out to be one that he wrote himself and is as entertaining and informative as his lectures.", 
            "Best chemistry professor I've ever had. Lectures are crystal clear, he's always available, and prepares you well for exams as well as orgo 2. We use his textbook, which is amazing in itself. Lots of homework and practice required to do well, but he makes it extremely fun and made me super enthusiastic about organic chemistry. Would take again!!",

After taking Organic Chemistry 1 and 2 with Klein, I went onto this site to tell everyone how awesome he is. He has a knack for explaining very difficult concepts. I wish I could take his class again. Literally.", 
            "Fair tests and clear lectures. About a half the class ends up with an A or B. A is the most common grade given out.",

He shows you how to approach Orgo problems, which is the most difficult and most important aspect of the subject. You'll have to work hard for an A, but it's Orgo. It's just the nature of the subject.", 
            "Klein is a great lecturer but summer orgo is not worth it. Cramming that much material into 6 weeks is ridiculously hard. Most of the A's in this class go to the people that are retaking orgo. There is no curve in the class but he does final redemption. while this may seem ok, his finals always end up screwing people over. take orgo during the year", 
            "If you want A, this class is quite challenging because there is hardly any curve. Klein is very nice and explains the materials very well. However, he does not go over difficult materials thoroughly, and thus it is quite common for students to panic during the exam.", 
            "While Professor Klein is a very good teacher, he sometimes fails to go over very important points that are usually slightly more difficult to explain. This makes it easier for him to explain everything so easily in class. What's bad about this is that usually everyone panics the day before the exam, cause we all realize that he never explained some", 
            "DRAW a line at 1600!!",

            "He made this class very easy. If you study, you will get an A. It doesn't boil down to \"getting orgo\" or \"not getting orgo\"- it's most definitely knowing what he tells you you have to know. That's it. Only problem is, don't think his class is good preparation for MCATs. Still, easy A.",

Definitely a class you will leave with a whole lot more in your head & your heart than you came in with.",

Truly an inspiration each and every day and really made it one of the most enjoyable classes I've taken. I think that every program at Hopkins would benefit by having professors take a page out of his book.",

Constantly correcting himself because he doesn't remember teaching the stuff before. Monochromatic and boring, but if you can manage to pay attention, not terribly hard. Reuses old test questions A LOT!", 
            "Karlin was sort of a hit or miss. Some lectures were very understandable, but in others he'd sort of ramble about something until he ended up just confusing everyone. Cheat sheets were very helpful, & he gave out a lot of back-tests & posted lectures. He was good professor if you had a decent chem. background but if not it was a little confusing.",

            "It's ridiculous how bad his lectures are. His handwriting is terrible and his voice invariably puts me to sleep. His tests are hard and don't always follow what he says will be on them, and my roommate even had a TA tell her that the test was ridiculously unfair. Try as hard as you can to get into Meyers' class, he's a much better professor.",

Note: A papers are rare!\" They do not give rubrics for papers NOR do they give A's. The professor refuses to put her lectures online because it's \"too much work\" to deal with Blackboard.",

This is both a good and a bad thing; they help elucidate the concepts we're studying, but she also runs out of time sometimes. Not a difficult class, but a rewarding one.",

He doesn't recycle old questions as much cause some kids complained about that. Why, I don't know. But if you know the material, his exams are straightforward. Good lecturer too.",

Funny guy. At first he seems unapproachable, but he's actually very understanding and probably the best teacher I've had at Hopkins.",

This was compounded by having a TA who barely spoke English and an awful textbook that was very difficult to understand & poor examples. Do well on the first exam or else he will assume you are a slacker.", 
            "Lectures are ok but very hard to understand what is going on. Sometimes, it is better to use class time to read the text book than attend his lectures. Tests are hard and does not give students enough time.",

Written homework was hell on earth and nothing like what we did in class. Exam format and grading were just horrible in terms of consistency and relevance to class work.",

Physics is tough in general, so the quality of the professor matters, and Prof. Leheny will go the extra mile for a student. BTW, you will need a clicker.",

Exams are pretty easy and straightforward, just make sure you pay attention in class and know the material. Curves generously."
